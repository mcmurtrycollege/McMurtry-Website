There are three things that make McMurtry superior above all other colleges - the people, the people, the people!  Murts are the most wonderful people you will meet at this University! Our mission as Magisters is to help students find connections to others, engage their interests, and see this place as home. We are entering our fifth year as Magisters!\",\"We love getting to know students and having them over at our home for food and fun, but also just chatting to get to know your hopes and dreams.\",\"To get that started, here’s a little about us: Noe and Jenifer have been married for 22 years.  We love to travel, cook, and hang out with friends.  Our most recent travels were to Yellowstone National Park.  We are a couple from all over – Jenifer was born in Brooklyn and Noe hails from South Texas (“the Valley”) and we met at the University of Texas at Austin in the graduate program in Sociology during a conflict about a desk – yes, please ask.\",\"Jenifer is a Professor in the Sociology Department specializing in race and ethnicity and its impact on identity, interpersonal relationships, and life chances. She has been working at Rice since 2006, and she enjoys the creative and intellectually dazzling graduate and undergraduate students.\",\"Noe is a freelance researcher. He loves biking as a way to exercise (ask him about the Bike paths in Houston!), getting to know the Rice community, carpentry, cooking--especially dishes that remind folks of home--and farmer’s markets.\",\"We have two boys.  Ricardo (age 19) is entering his second year at Trinity University. His passions are Parkour, weight lifting, climbing, and his goal is to study architecture and urban studies.  Our son Sam (age 14), who is starting high school this fall, is a guitar player, video gamer, chess enthusiast, and a programmer.\",\"Last, but not least, is our dog, Sunshine Charlie, who loves people (and belly rubs!). He’s a Siberian husky mix that we adopted in Spring of 2022 so he has literally lived his entire life at McMurtry.\",\"Welcome to McMurtry!\"],\"image\":\"../../../static/mcteam/magisters2024.png\"},{\"position\":\"College Coordinator\",\"names\":\"Jackie Carrizales\",\"body\":[\"My name is Jackie Carrizales and I am the McMurtry College Coordinator. I have been the Coordinator here since the week before O-Week in 2015, but I have been an associate at McMurtry since it opened in the Summer of 2009. I was so excited to be able to be a part of a college from the beginning and see the start of all of the traditions that make each college unique. I can’t believe that I’m lucky enough to spend every day here now and get paid for it!\",\"I have worked at Rice for 14 years. Away from McMurtry, I am married to my husband, Marc, and we have three adult sons, Max, Luke, and Leo. We also have three dogs, Azura, Shorty and Dagon, who think that they control the house (and they really do). My office is on the ground floor right outside the door to the commons. I love when students visit and tell e about what is going on with their lives, so please stop by any time to say 'Hi.' Grab some candy or a cup of coffee or tea.\",\"There are some very comfortable couches and chairs in my office, along with Squishmallows if you need a hug, and puzzles to challenge your brain. I’m always ready to talk about Asian dramas, Korean music, Astros baseball, or whatever interests you!\",\"Things you can do in my office:\"],\"image\":\"../../../static/mcteam/JackieCarrizales.jpeg\"},{\"position\":\"Resident Faculty Associates\",\"names\":\"Robin Paige and Sergio Chávez\",\"body\":[\"Welcome! We are so excited to welcome you to McMurtry! This is our first year as the Resident Faculty Associates at McMurtry and we look forward to getting to know you.\",\"We are Robin, Sergio, Abriel, Aarón and Missy the cat. Robin and Sergio are both originally from Northern California. Robin grew up just outside of San Francisco and Sergio grew up in the Salinas Valley. We both completed our undergraduate degrees in sociology at UC Davis, but we didn’t meet until we ended up as graduate students in the same program at Cornell University. We completed our PhDs in Development Sociology in 2008.\",\"Between the two of us we have lived, worked, and conducted research in a variety of places including Tijuana, Central Mexico, South Africa, New York, California, and North Carolina. Robin is an Associate Teaching Professor and the Director of Rice’s Center for Teaching Excellence. She came to Rice in 2012 and teaches courses on globalization, food systems, and gender in the Department of Sociology. Her research focuses on gender, food systems, and unpaid labor.\",\"Sergio is an Associate Professor in the Department of Sociology and came to Rice in 2010. His research focuses on internal and international migration, labor markets, social networks, and the border. He teaches courses on social inequality and work and occupations.\",\"Abriel and Aarón are our little munchkins. Abriel is six years old and loves swimming, riding her bike, and going to the Zoo (her favorite animal is the Cheetah). Aarón is four years old. He loves his cat Missy, motorcycles, basketball, and soccer. Missy is our 12-year-old cat who thinks she is a dog – she loves meeting new people. She would love nothing more than getting pets from new friends.\",\"As a family we love spending time outdoors, traveling, eating and cooking food. Robin loves reading books and listening to podcasts, lifting weights, cycling, and running. Sergio loves photography, movies, grilling, and exploring new food and restaurants in Houston.\",\"Please feel free to reach out to us and come by to say hello anytime. This is our second gig living in with students in the residential colleges and we are excited to be back!\"]},{\"position\":\"Second Floor RA\",\"names\":\"Tamara Jones\",\"body\":[\"Hello and welcome! I am the 2nd floor RA, Tamara – but no matter which floor you live on, consider me your RA.\",\"I am an Assistant Director of Academic Advising here at Rice and was born and raised in Houston. I have an MA in Sociology and love learning about human variation in every form – cultural, familial, personality, life choices, etc. This means I will want to learn all about your life story, so get ready! I hate chocolate, cinnamon, caramel, coconut, and peanut butter (I hope this isn’t a deal-breaker for you) but love strawberry, cherry, vanilla, and Funfetti! I also enjoy color consulting, wildlife and outdoor adventure shows and books, and games of all sorts – bowling, board games, video games, you name it.\",\"I enjoy reading, curating relaxing music playlists (ask me about my playlists for each day of the week), travel planning, and finding new, random Netflix series to watch.\",\"Helping keep things mad litty at all times are my daughters Seraphina, Aura, and Lila. Seraphina will be your chatty best friend and insist you join dance-offs, sing-offs, games, dress-up, long walks to the servery and commons, and anything else that strikes her fancy. Aura enjoys running, jumping, climbing, cartwheeling, and high-fives. Lila enjoys coloring, her critic’s choice cartoons, randomly shrieking, and hiding in a cozy nook.\",\"We know norms have changed with the pandemic, but reach out to me and I will help you however I can!\"],\"image\":\"../../../static/mcteam/TamaraCobb.jpeg\"},{\"position\":\"Third Floor RA\",\"names\":\"Deirdre Hunter\",\"body\":[\"Hello Murts! I am Deirdre Hunter, your new 3rd floor RA. I along with my two pups, Sandy and Nexus, are thrilled to welcome you with open arms and paws. I am a Lecturer of Engineering Design at the Oshman Engineering Design Kitchen (OEDK). In addition to teaching design courses for the Engineering Design Minor, I mentor students in the Sustaining Excellence in Research (SER) Scholars program, and teach in two Rice summer programs – Summer Experience in Engineering Design (SEED) and Rice Emerging Scholars Program (RESP). I received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Syracuse University and a PhD in Engineering Education from Virginia Tech (Go Hokies!). My research has focused on developing learner-centered environments in engineering classrooms, and teaching and learning metacognitive skills. I love thinking deeply and philosophizing about higher education systems and learning more broadly. Some of my hobbies include: playing games (from cards and board games, to organized sports and wacky competitions, I am game!), cheering on our Houston sports teams (Go Astros!!), drinking coffee (totally addicted, and no shame!) and finding great conversations.\",\"But most of all, I’m passionate about people. For me, it has always been more about who I am sharing moments with, than what I am doing in that moment. My personal life vision is “to build inclusive community” and I think every person has a deep desire to be known. Knowing someone starts with listening, and when we are truly known we begin to feel like we belong to a shared experience. So, let’s sit together over a meal or a cup of coffee; I am eager to hear your story!!\",\"Sandy is a five-year-old dachshund-beagle mix. She was born on the streets in Mexico and one afternoon, she found her way to my front gate, and eventually into my heart and my family. When I moved back to the States, she came with me. She loves naps, sun bathing, belly rubs, and doesn’t miss a meal!! Nexus is a five-year-old collie-Australian shepherd mix who started as my foster dog. He had lots of anxiety in the beginning, and through working with a trainer he has turned into a wonderful companion. I eventually realized that the best home for him was the one he already had. So he became my foster-failure and the third member of our little family. Nexus loves people, walks, and rough housing.\"]}]}");
