We are excited to meet you and to nurture the kind, open, and stimulating culture here at McMurtry. To do this, we will host events in our home, share meals with you in the commons, and help you navigate your life at the college. We hope that McMurtry will soon feel like your home away from home.","Jenifer is a Full Professor in the Sociology Department.  Her research and teaching focus on race and ethnicity and their significance for the ways individuals identify, form relationships, and experience well-being. She has been professor at Rice since 2006 and sincerely enjoys teaching and mentoring the creative and intellectually dazzling graduate and undergraduate students of the Rice community.  Noe is a researcher with expertise in education and community health. He loves carpentry, cooking, volunteering, kickboxing, and biking. Jenifer was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York and Noe hails from south Texas, known as \u201cthe Valley\u201d.  We met at University of Texas at Austin in the graduate program in Sociology. As a first year grad student, Noe stole Jenifer\u2019s desk in the teaching assistant lounge. We became fast friends, eventually started dating, and later married.  After moving across the country together, they decided to settle in Houston, where Jenifer started teaching at University of Houston and then moved over to Rice.","We have two boys: Ricardo, 15, and Sam, 9. Our kids love watching movies, playing video games, and being creative.  Ricardo\u2019s passion is Sasuke and American Ninja Warrior, the obstacle course shows - he was on the first season of American Ninja Warrior Junior under the name, \u201cThe Origami Ninja\u201d and continues to compete in ninja leagues.  Sam loves dancing and martial arts, especially Brazillian capoeira, which is almost a perfect blend of the two.  Together, they have a shared love of creating short films.  Sam and Ricardo were too happy to create a short video in honor of the 2020\u2019s beer bike theme, \u201cThe Mandapourian\u201d. We have lived in the Rice residential colleges as Head Resident Fellows for five years prior to becoming McMurtry Magisters and have enjoyed bringing some of our favorite hobbies to the students on campus.","We are all eager to welcome you to the college and learn more about the hobbies and activities that you enjoy!  As new students, you are an important part of McMurtry. We will all work together to energize our community. Keep in mind, McMurtry is your college \u2013 the most AMAZING and BEST residential college at Rice. We encourage you to have fun, ask questions, be safe, be active, and be creative.

Both of us have been in Texas for a long time so our accents have been diluted. Alana received her BA in Anthropology from UT Austin and her MED in Educational Anthropology from the University of Houston. Brian received his BA in Kinesiology, and his MA and PhD in Exercise Physiology from UT Austin. We were married in Austin, TX in December of 1995.","Brian accepted a faculty position in the Department of Kinesiology at Rice in 1996, where he currently serves as Clinical Professor teaching Human Physiology, Exercise Physiology, and preventative medicine related courses. In 2004, he also assumed a new role in Academic Advising, and with a few changes over the years, he currently serves as the Senior Associate Dean of Undergraduates. In this role, he has responsibilities for the Office of Academic Advising, Center for Career Development, Center for Teaching Excellence, and Office of Study Abroad. He is also responsible for support of the campus wide Residential Colleges and Associates Program.","After Alana finished her education, she transitioned to working in software development and technology management. Currently, she works as the Director of Project Management and part of the leadership team for OpenStax at Rice University. OpenStax is a nonprofit organization committed to improving student access to quality learning materials. For more information, please visit openstax.org.","We both have lots of personal interests. We absolutely love, and dote on our dog, \u201cBogie Theodore Gibson\u201d, and we enjoy travel, exercise, and spending time with family and friends. We also have separate personal interests. Alana enjoys books, music, cooking, and art. Brian enjoys playing and coaching sports, lifting weights, wildlife, and photography. We have been living with students in the residential colleges since we arrived in Houston in 1996, but we were \u201cpromoted\u201d to McMurtry in 2014. As you can tell, we like college life. In fact, we\u2019re not sure we can remember what it is like to NOT be in college.

In addition to teaching design courses for the Engineering Design Minor, I mentor students in the Sustaining Excellence in Research (SER) Scholars program, and teach in two Rice summer programs \u2013 Summer Experience in Engineering Design (SEED) and Rice Emerging Scholars Program (RESP). I received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Syracuse University and a PhD in Engineering Education from Virginia Tech (Go Hokies!). My research has focused on developing learner-centered environments in engineering classrooms, and teaching and learning metacognitive skills. I love thinking deeply and philosophizing about higher education systems and learning more broadly.

For me, it has always been more about who I am sharing moments with, than what I am doing in that moment.

He had lots of anxiety in the beginning, and through working with a trainer he has turned into a wonderful companion. I eventually realized that the best home for him was the one he already had.
