As a Computer Science and Statistics double major, you can often find her in the commons coding away, but if she\u2019s not doing that, she\u2019s probably ordering Postmates, watching an emotional TV show, and listening to the latest Spotify hits all at the same time. Sue is always down to eat any type of food with you (especially Korean), learn some new makeup tricks, or just go on a walk around the inner loop to talk about whatever is on your mind. If you catch her awake in the late hours of the night, don\u2019t be surprised if you proudly tell her about how you woke up early or went to the gym and are met with one simple question: \u201cWhy?\u201d Sue will always be there to hug you, believe in you, give you her most honest advice, get you some tea, and hand you her famous Perry the Platypus stuffed animal for some extra love (and shame you for trying to better yourself through physical activity). You\u2019re so lucky to have Sue not only as your Advisor but also your forever friend."},{"name":"AJ Valenty","year":"Sophomore","major":"Computer Science","from":"Austin, TX","image":"../../../static/oweek/clue/AJ.jpg","bio":"Who is AJ Valenty you ask? Stong. Independent. Bold. Caring. Sassy. And a certified cutie! Not only is he a beloved Murt, but he\u2019s also on track to being one of the first (maybe the first) Rice Varsity Tennis players to graduate with a Computer Science Major. But when he\u2019s not doing lines of code, you can find AJ at the rec DOMINATING the calf raise machine. Take look at AJ and you\u2019ll notice the voluptuousness of his calves. Every day is a #calf day for AJ. Forget a pillow? No problem! AJ is always willing to lend a calf, and trust me, you\u2019ll get the best night sleep of you life. In his free time he is a crafting king, and will school anyone on PVP servers (I speak from experience). Give me a diamond sword and AJ a wooden pickaxe and he will still win 10/10 times. With all these activities, one might think AJ must be tired? He is, but if you need a friend at 2am, just go to the commons and you\u2019ll find AJ working, but never too busy to chat."},{"name":"Meheret Adera","year":"Sophomore","major":"Kinesiology (Health Sciences), Global Health Technologies","from":"Dallas, TX","image":"../../../static/oweek/clue/Meheret.jpg","bio":"Who\u2019s got the laugh of Mickey Mouse, the cheeks of Sandy the Squirrel, and the posture of an old lady? Meheret Adera. This Ethiopian turned-cowgirl from Dallas, TX is majoring in Kinesiology and minoring in Global Health Technologies. Meheret will steal your heart like the pops at Steel City\u2014literally, she consumes around ten popsicles a day in the summer, and she will spill all the tea on the best flavors. Just make sure not to accidentally spell her name MEHERT \u2026 or do if you\u2019re looking to get her a personalized secret santa gift (ask Steven Feng about that one). Meheret is the kind of friend who will stay up talking to you for hours about anything, even when both of you definitely have work to do, but some topics that are especially close to her heart are nail art, Gustavo Rocqu\xe9 from Rocqu\xe9 Records, the iridocyclitis vine, and the time a goat injured her leg at camp. A talented Turkish dancer, she will gladly teach you the Cotton-Eyed Joe dance when Old Town Road starts playing (it definitely makes sense, just ask her). She also loves jamming to Ethiopian and Latin music on her frequent walks to Fondy basement. If you need advice at 4 am, Meheret\u2019s probably awake. If you need someone to be your fire, Meheret\u2019s your one desire -- she\u2019s got a black belt in taekwondo and she\u2019s not afraid to use it. Meheret will be there for you no matter what, so enjoy having the funniest, quirkiest, kindest advisor you could ask for. As Big Time Rush said, get ready to \u201clive it big time\u201d with Meheret as your O-Week Advisor."},{"name":"Sai Sriram","year":"Junior","major":"Computer Science, Neuroscience","from":"Tampa, FL","image":"../../../static/oweek/clue/Sai.jpg","bio":"Sigh\u2026 where does one even start to describe Sai (verbalized as -sigh-). Is he a 5\u201910\u201d mean green coding machine? Is he smol, but swole? Is he a Bakerite who eloped to McMurtry, the best college? Is he excited to welcome you all? Yes. Yes. Yes. And Yes! This Computer Science and Neuroscience double major hails from Florida, the Sunshine State, but still can\u2019t handle the sticky heat of Texas, so he can always be seen with his proudly McMurtry-adorned water bottle. To maintain his active lifestyle, this junior scarfs down pizzas from the Hoot (The late-night food stand serving hungry students) on the daily. If the Hoot isn\u2019t opened, Sai\u2019s late-night hunger can only be satiated with Rice Village\u2019s infamous YoYo\u2019s Hotdogs. When Sai isn\u2019t on the grind, he can be spotted lifting irons at the rec or on the bike track training for next year\u2019s Beer Bike."}],"image":"../../../static/oweek/clue/Schoolboygroup.jpg","video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5MkWPUXZPNA"},{"name":"UNO Mars: Draw 24k Magic","advisors":[{"name":"Eitan Woloski","year":"Junior","major":"Physics","from":"McAllen, TX","image":"../../../static/oweek/uno/Eitan.JPG","bio":"If you see an orange Astros cap amongst a Rice crowd, chances are you\u2019ve had an Eitan sighting. They\u2019re certainly not rare, though: this Physics pre-law from McAllen, TX, is all over campus. Catch him walking from \u201cCha-board\u201d meetings, watching and performing comedy, or simply having a good time hanging around the college. In his free time, he likes spending time with friends or watching Astros and Rockets games. Eitan lives quite a spicy life: he\u2019s often found with Takis, Miguelitos, or Tabasco and boy does this man make a mean Cholent. This junior is going bananas for O-Week, so get excited!

Holding a dual citizenship with the U.S. and Israel, she calls the equally spunky Washington D.C. her home. Whether she\u2019s playing powder puff, softball, or re-watching Grey\u2019s anatomy for the 12th time, you\u2019ll always find a mischievous smile on her face. Val is a rising senior at the (HUGE) Sid Richardson College, taking on the real world whether it\u2019s ready or not after her graduation in 2020. She is majoring in Civil and Environmental Engineering with a minor in Politics, Law, and Social Thought. While her love (and worry) for the environment is at the forefront of her academic inclinations, you can also find her fascinated with history and feminist thought. So, go ahead and say hello; she has a lot to say!"},{"name":"Catherine Hettler","year":"Sophomore","major":"Psychology, Visual and Dramatic Arts, Neuroscience","from":"South Korea/San Antonio, TX","image":"../../../static/oweek/uno/Catherine.jpg","bio":"If you\u2019re reading this, congratulations! You just scored yourself one of the best Advisors at McMurtry! Coming to us from San Antonio (but originally South Korea), Catherine is a Psychology and VADA (Visual and Dramatic Arts) double major bent on taking the least amount of finals possible. Nonetheless, Catherine is one of the kindest and funniest people that you will ever meet. As an artist, she\u2019s super creative, and is always finding ways to make something new. She loves animals (maybe too much), but can\u2019t be around them too often because she\u2019s allergic to them (as well as pretty much everything else). And as for activities that DON\u2019T induce allergic reactions, she loves watching Netflix, scrolling through niche Facebook pages, and just being an all-around lovely person. If you ever need her, she will respond to any text within thirty seconds\u2014but don\u2019t call, she gets nervous. So, get ready for an incredible O-Week, because there\u2019s no way you could have gotten a better team of advisors!"},{"name":"Shaquille Que","year":"Sophomore","major":"Computer Science","from":"Quezon City, Philippines","image":"../../../static/oweek/uno/Shaquille.jpg","bio":"Shaquille Wyan Que: 99 pounds of pure GOLD, Peer Academic Advisor and Computer Science TA.

You\u2019ll find him in the commons doing homework, helping others with math, and falling prey to the endless memes on Facebook. Even if he takes every chance he can to roast you (all in good fun), he\u2019s your go-to person for any questions you have about Rice, academic planning, or if you just need someone to vent to. Just don\u2019t ask him where Oregon is (or any geographical knowledge), he\u2019ll probably tell you that it\u2019s on the opposite coast.
