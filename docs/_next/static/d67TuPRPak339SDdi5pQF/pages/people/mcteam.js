We live right next to the college, across from the commons. We are here to foster the intellectual, cultural, and social life at the college and to support you during your years at McMurtry. We are excited to meet you and to nurture the kind, open, and stimulating culture at McMurtry. To do this, we will host events in our home, share meals with you in the commons, and help you navigate your life at the college. We hope that McMurtry will soon feel like your home away from home.","Margaret is a full professor in the Psychology Department. Her specialty is applied psychology, and she studies performance in educational and work settings. She has been at Rice for 13 years, and she loves mentoring the incredibly talented students she has met here. Chris is a high school math teacher at the High School for the Visual and Performing Arts (HSPVA) in Houston. He loves all sports and has been a high school basketball coach for the last 16 years. We are both from Minneapolis, Minnesota and love the color purple (Purple Rain and the Minnesota Vikings). We met in high school and were married in Minnesota but moved to Atlanta, Georgia shortly afterward for graduate school. We have two girls: Lucy, 15, and Liza, 13, who were born in Atlanta. Our kids love watching movies, reading books, creating art, and swimming. We also have our German Shepherds, Felix, who you will see walking Margaret around campus. We are all eager to welcome you to the college!","As new students, you are an important part of McMurtry. We will all work together to energize our community. Keep in mind, McMurtry is your college \u2013 the BEST residential college at Rice. We encourage you to have fun, ask questions, be safe, be active, and be creative.

We would like to tell you a little about ourselves so that you will know who keeps walking their heavy-breathing bulldog all around the building.","Alana is from Providence, RI, and Brian is from the rural town of Rehoboth, MA. Both of us have been in Texas for a long time so our accents have been diluted. Alana received her BA in Anthropology from UT Austin and her MED in Educational Anthropology from the University of Houston. Brian received his BA in Kinesiology, and his MA and PhD in Exercise Physiology from UT Austin. We were married in Austin, TX in December of 1995.","Brian accepted a faculty position in the Department of Kinesiology at Rice in 1996, where he currently serves as Professor in the Practice teaching Human Physiology and Exercise Physiology courses. In 2004, he also assumed a new role in Academic Advising, and with a few changes over the years, he currently serves as the Associate Dean of Undergraduates. In this role, he has responsibilities for the Office of Academic Advising, the Center for Career Development, and the Center for Teaching Excellence.","After Alana finished her education, she transitioned to working in software development and technology management. Currently, she works as a Project Manager for OpenStax at Rice University. OpenStax is a nonprofit organization committed to improving student access to quality learning materials. Even though OpenStax textbooks are free, they are very high quality, peer-reviewed, and customizable. For more information, please visit openstax.org.","We both have lots of personal interests. We absolutely love, and dote on our dog, \u201cBogie Theodore Gibson\u201d, and we enjoy travel, exercise, and spending time with family and friends. We also have separate personal interests. Alana enjoys books, music, cooking, and art. Brian enjoys playing and coaching sports, lifting weights, wildlife, and photography. We have been living with students in the residential colleges since we arrived in Houston in 1996, but we were \u201cpromoted\u201d to McMurtry in 2014. As you can tell, we like college life. In fact, we\u2019re not sure we can remember what it is like to NOT be in college. We consider ourselves non-judgmental adults who are here to share our lives with Murts to whatever extent they wish."]},"d":{"names":"Tamara Cobb and Andre Cobb","body":["Hello and welcome! We are the 2nd floor RAs- Tamara, Andre, and our 3 daughters and we are so excited to be a part of the McMurtry family!","Tamara is an Assistant Director of Academic Advising here at Rice and was born and raised in Houston. She has an MA in Sociology and loves learning about human variation in every form \u2013 cultural, familial, personality, life choices, etc. This means she will want to learn all about your life story, so get ready! She hates chocolate, cinnamon, caramel, and peanut butter (she hopes this isn\u2019t a deal-breaker for you) but loves strawberry, cherry, vanilla, and Funfetti! She also enjoys color consulting, wildlife and outdoor adventure shows and books, and games of all sorts \u2013 bowling, board games, video games, you name it.","Andre is the Department Business Administrator in the English department at the University of Houston, and was also born and raised in Houston. He enjoys reading about politics and law, critical film analysis, philosophy (his undergraduate major!), and sports \u2013 particularly the Green Bay Packers and yelling at their coaching staff. Andre and Tamara actually met in freshman year of high school at Bellaire High School! Together, they enjoy reading, curating relaxing music playlists, travel planning, and watching and re-watching beloved TV series like The Simpsons, The Sopranos, The Wire, The Americans, and Game of Thrones, among others.","Seraphina is a Rising Kindergartner and enjoys creating her own songs and accompanying dance routines, reading, constructing buildings with Legos and Magna-tiles, and swimming. Aura is 3 \xbd and enjoys climbing things and people, creating elaborate vignettes with Paw Patrol and Peppa Pig figurines, and shriek-cackling. Lila is approaching 2 \xbd and enjoys eating all of the food on our planet (impressively with only 4 teeth), smiling just because, throwing random objects off of the back of the couch or out of her playpen, and marathon naps. Together, they enjoy the Moana soundtrack, rainbows and rainbow accessories, and ball pits.","We welcome you to stop by and talk to us anywhere around McMurtry and we can\u2019t wait to get to know all of you!"]},"e":{"names":"Brad Blunt and Marla Sanders","body":["The 3rd floor RA apartment is home to Brad & Marla, plus three kids and a shaggy mutt - all of whom are excited for all of you to be part of an exciting year at McMurtry.","Born in Ohio, raised in Illinois, and educated in Iowa, Brad never expected to leave the Midwest, until a voice teacher invited him to venture down to Texas for a while. That was in 1996. He\u2019s been here pretty much ever since, and since 2012 he has been an Assistant Director of Academic Advising at Rice.","Marla, on the other hand, was born in Houston and stayed put. Why leave a good thing, right? She works beyond the hedges (that\u2019s Rice-Speak for \u201coff-campus\u201d) as a sales representative for The Detering Company. If a house in Houston is fancy with something custom-\xadbuilt out of wood, her company probably did the work.","Brad\u2019s passion is music. He has a master\u2019s degree in voice and sang for several seasons at Houston Grand Opera, which allowed him to be a pirate, a slave, a gypsy, a marauding assassin and a Parisian flower vendor in just one year. Marla is the real chanteuse of the duo, and she also loves design and making things with her hands (and a lot of hot glue). Together, we enjoy reading, local bars with live music, hiking, and ice cream. We REALLY like ice cream.","Brad\u2019s children, Jonah and Sophie, spend most of the school year near San Antonio, but you will see them most weekends. Jonah is entering 7th grade and is into video games, reading, and playing percussion. Fifth-\xadgrader Sophie is the family animal lover and artist, and she is following in her father\u2019s footsteps by always trying to be the biggest ham in the room. She has a lot of competition for that title from Marla\u2019s daughter Ainsley, who is also in 5th grade and has an encyclopedic knowledge of Harry Potter and Minecraft. Smokey the shaggy mutt is very friendly and loves to play. He also is the guest of honor for the best study break of the year.
