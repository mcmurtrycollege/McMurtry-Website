We,\r\n            your three Advance To GO-Week Coordinators, have been planning for your arrival since well before you were\r\n            placed in McMurtry. In fact, we have been working since January to select your Advisors and your Co-Advisors. This summer we have prepared this book for you, matched you with a roommate, and carefully placed\r\n            you into an O-Week group. We also planned the majority of O-Week events you will be participating in at\r\n            McMurtry. One of the best things about Rice is that the administration places a great deal of trust in students\r\n            (i.e. us) to run things. In turn, we work extremely hard to make sure that you have a smooth transition into\r\n            Rice, both academically and socially. Your Advisors will be your guides for most of O-Week, but weâ€™ll largely\r\n            be working to make sure everything runs smoothly. We are elated that you will be joining us at McMurtry and\r\n            we are beyond excited to meet you. See you August 18!\r\n</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default Coords;"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AAEA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AALA;AAQA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AALA;AAQA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AALA;AACA;AAQA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AALA;AAUA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAfA;AACA;AA4BA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
