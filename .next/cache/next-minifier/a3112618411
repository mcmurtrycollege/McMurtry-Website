I am the recipient of a 2008 Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Research Fellowship, a National Science Foundation CAREER award, and a 2007 ACM SIGMOD Best Paper Award. I have been at Rice since January, 2009, and I was on the faculty of the computer science department at the University of Florida from 2002, through August, 2010. \\\\n\\\\tIn my spare time, I enjoy running, gardening, and outdoor activities such as hiking, climbing, and whitewater boating. I\\'ve walked the John Muir Trail twice (250+ miles total each time, including side trips) as well as Glyndywr\\'s Way in Wales (135+ miles), carrying my then-3-year-old son on my back. I\\'ve walked the Kerry Way in Ireland (130+ miles). For that one, I carried my then-5-year-old son about half the way. I\\'ve hiked and/or climbed 12 out of the 13 14,000 foot peaks in California. In one particular exploit, my wife and I floated a whitewater raft (home-made from scratch using a sewing machine, glue, and plastic) over 100 miles down the Nizina River (and beyond) in Alaska.\"},{\"name\":\"Emily Houlik-Ritchey\",\"school\":\"Humanities\",\"department\":\"English\",\"email\":\"emily.houlik-ritchey@rice.edu\",\"office\":\"235 Herring Hall\",\"bio\":\"\"},{\"name\":\"Laura Kabiri\",\"school\":\"Natural Sciences\",\"department\":\"Kinesiology\",\"email\":\"laura.kabiri@rice.edu\",\"office\":\"S203 Tudor Field House\",\"bio\":\"\"},{\"name\":\"Ozge Gurcanli\",\"school\":\"Social Sciences\",\"department\":\"Psychology\",\"email\":\"ozge.gurcanli@rice.edu\",\"office\":\"456 Sewall Hall\",\"bio\":\"\\xd6zge G\\xfcrcanl\\u0131 received her Ph.D. in Cognitive Science from Johns Hopkins University in 2012. In January 2013, fresh out of grad school, she started her career as a teaching faculty at the Department of Psychology, Rice University. Since then she has taught courses such as Introduction to Psychology, Developmental Psychology, Language Acquisition, and Research Methods. In her research, she explores how monolingual and bilingual speakers, both children and adults, talk about the spatial world around them by using the combinatorial property of language. In her teaching, she uses a healthy combination of traditional and innovative methods. She is a huge believer of experiential learning, and her developmental psychology course got university-wide recognition because of its experiential component. In addition to being a teaching faculty, she serves as a major advisor and the director of the honors program in the Department of Psychology.\"}]}')},Lz15:function(e,a,t){(window.__NEXT_P=window.__NEXT_P||[]).push([\"/people/divisionaladvisors\",function(){var e=t(\"X+Xt\");return{page:e.default||e}}])},\"X+Xt\":function(e,a,t){\"use strict\";t.r(a);var i=t(\"q1tI\"),n=t.n(i),o=t(\"AM0r\"),r=t(\"ivdq\"),l=t(\"e02a\"),s=t(\"0YTE\"),c=t(\"0iUn\"),d=t(\"sLSF\"),h=t(\"MI3g\"),m=t(\"a7VT\"),u=t(\"AT/M\"),p=t(\"Tit0\"),f=t(\"QKO/\"),g=t(\"JE6X\"),v=t(\"RUXa\"),y=(t(\"U6OQ\"),function(e){function a(e){var t;return Object(c.default)(this,a),(t=Object(h.default)(this,Object(m.default)(a).call(this,e))).state={closed:!0},t.handleClick=t.handleClick.bind(Object(u.default)(t)),t}return Object(p.default)(a,e),Object(d.default)(a,[{key:\"handleClick\",value:function(){this.setState({closed:!this.state.closed})}},{key:\"render\",value:function(){return n.a.createElement(f.Box,{width:[.9,.8,.7,.6]},n.a.createElement(\"div\",{className:this.state.closed?\"advisor-card-hidden\":\"advisor-card-visible\",onClick:this.handleClick},n.a.createElement(\"div\",{className:\"advisor-card-content\"},n.a.createElement(\"h1\",null,this.props.name),n.a.createElement(\"h2\",null,\"School of \",this.props.school),n.a.createElement(\"h4\",null,\"Department of \",this.props.department),n.a.createElement(\"h4\",null,\"Email: \",this.props.email),n.a.createElement(\"h4\",null,\"Office: \",this.props.office)),n.a.createElement(\"div\",{className:this.state.closed?\"divisional-advisor-dropdown-hidden\":\"divisional-advisor-dropdown-visible\"},n.a.createElement(\"p\",{className:\"advisor-bio\"},this.props.bio))))}}]),a}(n.a.Component)),w=function(){return n.a.createElement(\"div\",{className:\"divisional-advisors-page\"},n.a.createElement(v.a,{width:350,title:\"Divisional Advisors\"}),n.a.createElement(\"div\",null,n.a.createElement(f.Flex,{flexDirection:\"row\",justifyContent:\"center\",flexWrap:\"wrap\"},g.a.map(function(e){var a=e.name,t=e.school,i=e.department,o=e.email,r=e.office,l=e.bio;return n.a.createElement(y,{key:a,name:a,school:t,department:i,email:o,office:r,bio:l})}))))};t(\"NHen\"),a.default=function(){return n.a.createElement(\"div\",{className:\"page\"},n.a.createElement(o.a,null),n.a.createElement(r.a,null),n.a.createElement(l.a,null),n.a.createElement(w,null),n.a.createElement(s.a,null))}}},[[\"Lz15\",1,0,2]]]);"}
