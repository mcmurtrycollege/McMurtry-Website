Hayden’s a guy you can both mess around with and trust, so feel comfortable ribbing him and confiding in him. Most of all, if you’re in his family, he’s always down to ride with you in whatever you do (preferably in his Mustang). This means Hayden will try new things and grow with you.

While she can be found just about anywhere on campus, Kelsey is first and foremost a Murt or as she would say, “MUUUUURRTTTTTT!” Pack your sunglasses and get ready to meet sunshine in human form."},{name:"Aaron Pathak",year:"Sophomore",major:"Social Policy Analysis",from:"Dallas, TX",image:"../../../static/oweek/candyland/Aaron.jpg",bio:"If you are reading this, you may be wondering who this enigmatic, ethnic advisor may be. He is an engineer that gave up on engineering as soon as he stepped foot on Rice campus. He is a pre-med that isn’t really pre-med even though he really likes and knows a lot about pre-med. He is a biracial (half Chinese and half Nepali), but he is also a coconut (#ifykyk). He is THE most confusing man on Rice Campus. Coming to you from Jones College, this sophomore Social Policy Analysis major currently hails from Dallas, Texas, but he is originally from rural Louisiana. Known for being the best procrastinator on campus, no one knows how Aaron manages to finish all his work. He regularly takes 3-hour naps, schedules “procrastination time” in the middle of the night, and spends nearly six hours everyday just browsing Reddit. With his Sperrys and 3-quarter zip, Aaron gives off a frat boy vibe, but don’t let this fool you. Aaron is one of the nicest and smartest people that you will ever meet. As the go-to organizer of all events, Aaron is sure to plan lots of activities for your O-Week group. He might even take you on another European backpacking trip or impromptu visit to New Orleans. Despite not being from McMurtry, you can count on this Co-Advisor to always be there for you - Aaron is truly one of the most selfless and caring people at Rice, and is always willing to listen to you rant or celebrate your victories. He can’t wait to help welcome you to your new home at Rice.

A name you can spot on any list simply because its longer than the others and sticks out. She’s pre-med and majoring in Cognitive Sciences, with minors in Business/Biochem. She loves misplacing stuff, *cough* suitcase *cough* (she lost her suitcase during O-Week, found four days later). She is an incredibly determined human being who has an addiction to caffeine and decided to add an extra identification to the front of her credit card: her own face. Don’t even get started with her obsession with rose gold. Also, there is no such thing as a sleep schedule for her, as you can find her asleep either at 2 PM or 2 AM, depending on the day. Even though she might be incredibly busy, she genuinely cares about you and will do anything to help you. Originally from Los Angeles, California, she sometimes (always) misses the California sunshine. Find her at Fondy 6th working on chemistry, or generally laughing loud enough to wake everyone up. She’s going to be sure to make your first week and first year at Rice as great as it can be!"}],image:"../../../static/oweek/candyland/Lalagroup.jpg",video:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GO0q-lRWAhI"},{name:"Lil’ Yahtzee",advisors:[{name:"Alex Lammers",year:"Sophomore",major:"Bioengineering",from:"Tecumseh, Michigan",image:"../../../static/oweek/yahtzee/Alex.jpg",bio:"Does Alex look familiar? That’s probably because you recognize this political icon from a CNN town hall when he was chosen to ask a question to then-presidential hopeful, billionaire Howard Schultz. That’s right. He may be a hardcore bioengineer who travelled to Malawi this summer for global health thingies (we aren’t engineers), but he is also a civically engaged, ~woke~ KING. Although he may seem extremely vanilla on the surface, buried deep within him is a sassy monster. However, his sass is not nearly as suppressed as his real laugh, which he hides because if unleashed, an earthquake erupts on the other side of the world. Regardless, if you need someone to discuss feminism in blockbuster action movies, the brilliance of Brie Larson, literally any HBO show, or how to feed tapirs (we didn’t know what they were either) with, and you don’t mind the HEAVIEST midwestern accent on the planet, Alex is your guy. In all seriousness, Alex is one of the most selfless and caring people on the planet and he will always be there for you with an endless supply of tupperware filled with snacks."},{name:"Tatyanna Epps",year:"Sophomore",major:"Sociology",from:"Temple, TX",image:"../../../static/oweek/yahtzee/Tatyanna.jpg",bio:"Tatyanna Epps Bust down Tatyanna!!

This girl is a procrastination queen but that doesn’t stop her from killing it at life. As Treasurer of BSA, your McMurtry Diversity Facilitator, and a star Powderpuff line(wo)man, she’s super involved around campus. Not to mention, she’s also a rap queen and literally knows the lyrics to every song imaginable. Don’t even get me started on her love for Nicki Minaj. While we’re on the topic of her various skills, Tya is especially attuned to very faint smells, has a complex palate when it comes to food, and loves very cold climates (keeping her room at meat locker temperatures). Does she have Spidey senses? We think so. You’ll often find her awake at 5am, busting out an essay, or just casually listening to music. Tya is the best type of person for deep conversations but can also be somebody you can easily laugh with.

Out of the corner of your eye you see the llama from The Emperor’s New Groove. Oh wait. It’s Sachi Khemka. During the 2018-2019 school year, Sachi managed to lose her ID, mail key, and two room keys. Imagine the kind of determination needed to lose so many valuables in such a short period of time! This focus and drive truly defines Sachi’s character and makes her the successful student she is (even though she sleeps through her morning classes…at 4 p.m.). As a premed Biological Sciences major who is also a trained dancer, a Camp Kesem counselor, and a biomedical lab member, Sachi is the kind of person who seems to do it all, but if you ever want someone to watch a trashy rom-com, she will drop everything, walk over and join you (probably like 20 minutes later because this girl is nothing if not punctual)! Her favorites include The Last Song (mainly because of Liam Hemsworth), The Fosters, and The Vampire Diaries. Never watch horror movies with her, though. This girl is even scared of her own face in the mirror. Also, a piece of advice: Sachi is going to need to borrow both a laptop, phone charger, and blanket from you at some point, so keep them handy. As Sachi would say, “welcome to Riiiiiice,” and I’m sure you will all ~genuinely~ love your O-Week Advisor :)"},{name:"Grant Lu",year:"Senior",major:"Bioengineering",from:"Houston, TX",image:"../../../static/oweek/yahtzee/Grant.jpg",bio:"Have you ever met the human embodiment of charisma?

Well versed in English, Mandarin, Spanish, and the language of friendship, this Advisor will be sure to shower you with advice. If that doesn’t let you know enough about his personality, look at the words that almost rhyme with Lu: cool, jewel, fun fuel, nice shoe, too good to be true, lover of voodoo, sleeps no drool, eyes like the moon, blows you away like “atchoo!” and you’ll be stuck to him like G.Lu! Despite being an avid collector of things that are soft, Grant is surprisingly sturdy for someone who got hit by a car.

Sean currently has a standing bet that he’ll make the club basketball team next year, while having no organized-sport basketball experience in his life.

Callie is a dedicated history major, and you can often find her working on readings or an essay at Coffeehouse. If you ever need to see photos of a cute dog, Callie’s family recently got a new puppy, and she WILL show you photos - whether you like it or not! Callie is genuine, an amazing listener, and one of the most enthusiastic people at Rice.

Honestly one of the most open and warm personalities on campus, and you can talk about anything with this girl from how to pretend that your fallen tooth crown was your lucky pebble (ask her to tell that story, it’s so funny you might pee your pants) to the best eateries in Houston. Lily has been through many majors, so she has a well-rounded perspective that makes her easy to connect with. She also has very diverse tastes in music and tv shows, so no matter if you’re a country boy, an EDM babe, a crime show fan, or a K-drama lover, you will find a soul sister in her.

Every day is a #calf day for AJ. Forget a pillow? No problem! AJ is always willing to lend a calf, and trust me, you’ll get the best night sleep of you life. In his free time he is a crafting king, and will school anyone on PVP servers (I speak from experience). Give me a diamond sword and AJ a wooden pickaxe and he will still win 10/10 times.

Just make sure not to accidentally spell her name MEHERT … or do if you’re looking to get her a personalized secret santa gift (ask Steven Feng about that one). Meheret is the kind of friend who will stay up talking to you for hours about anything, even when both of you definitely have work to do, but some topics that are especially close to her heart are nail art, Gustavo Rocqué from Rocqué Records, the iridocyclitis vine, and the time a goat injured her leg at camp. A talented Turkish dancer, she will gladly teach you the Cotton-Eyed Joe dance when Old Town Road starts playing (it definitely makes sense, just ask her). She also loves jamming to Ethiopian and Latin music on her frequent walks to Fondy basement. If you need advice at 4 am, Meheret’s probably awake. If you need someone to be your fire, Meheret’s your one desire -- she’s got a black belt in taekwondo and she’s not afraid to use it.
