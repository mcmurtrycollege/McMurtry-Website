          "description": "The Diversity committee is focused on ensuring that DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) is a top priority at McMurtry! This involves being a resource for all of Murt in case they have any DEI related concerns that they would like to see addressed (e.g. lack of inclusion of certain backgrounds in events, interpersonal issues related to DEI, etc.) We also plan events and initiatives that can expose more Murts to the importance of having mature discussions surrounding DEI related topics. This past year, we have done the following initiatives: created a linktree that gives Murts access to lists of DEI resources on and off campus as well as an optionally anonymous feedback form; created a bulletin board (posted near the entrance of Murt commons) where people can post DEI and cultural event flyers; created a DEI instagram where we will be posting information about DEI issues relevant to Rice students right now; and collaborated with affinity groups at Murt to host cultural events.<br/><br/>We plan on hosting more DEI-discussion based events in the near future, as well as increasing communication between the diversity committee and all of Murt through email announcements and reminders of any important upcoming DEI events or DEI-related resources. If you are passionate about increasing the importance of DEI at Murt, you should join this committee!",
