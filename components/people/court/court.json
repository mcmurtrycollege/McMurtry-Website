An enjoyer of the finer things in life, Kile is an avid reader, bouldering stud, professional Letterboxd review writer, and theater kid at heart (he played the little boy in Marie Poppins in a Broadway caliber production and loves talking about it, seriously just ask him). In closing, music means alot to Kile (Alex G, Neutral Milk Hotel, The Beatles, and Car Seat Headrest to name a few) and this dude absolutely shreds on the acoustic guitar. - By Jackson"

      "bio": "Jackson “Justice” Harvey: he’s a Political Science major (socially conscious ?!?!), Spanish minor (bilingual king jajaja), and majorly handsome (meow!). Hailing from the distant land of Houston, TX, he can be spotted in the wild primarily looking out for the safety of McMurtry college, or brushing up on the latest edition of the alcohol policy. However, if you take a peak past his peacekeeping persona, you can find him dancing salsa and bachata, watching foreign films polyglottaly (if this is a word, he’d know), or playing soccer (ole!). The justice of McMurtry is firmly grasped in his loving hands! - By Kile"
