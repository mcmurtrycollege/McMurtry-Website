We want McMurtry to be a welcoming home for everyone and that means valuing inclusivity and supporting every member of our community. In the past summer, our nation has seen a monumental change in our social and political landscape, not only amid the coronavirus pandemic, but also with specific regards to the recent deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and many other Black Americans. Black Murts, we understand that this is a continual and potentially exhausting discussion, so if you do not feel like you are in a space to read further, please do not worry. To all other Murts, we believe that all of you should take the time to read the statement and explore the resources that follow.\\\",\\\"Non-Black Murts, you cannot join the fight for equality and anti-racism only when it is convenient or when the media pressures you to take action. The tragic deaths of Black Americans persist today because of years of systematic and institutionalized racism. The forces needed to end this cycle of oppression requires everyone to be deliberate and proactive in their engagement with issues of racism and inequality. It is not enough to be not racist, we must constantly strive to be anti-racist and actively denounce any instance of racism or inequality we witness or allow to exist. We must also remember to amplify the voices of groups who are constantly silenced by ignorance, bigotry, and racism, but not speak over or for them. We owe this much to those who are grieving, those who live in fear, and those whose lives are shaped by the persistent racial inequality in this country.\\\",\\\"Although we challenge every member of the Murt and Rice community to take responsibility for combatting racism and injustice, we do not expect you to do this alone. As a community, we will work towards making McMurtry more welcoming, comprehensive, and inclusive for all people. We will strive towards equitable relations with Murts, H&D, and RUPD, and we will continue to engage in open and educational conversations with members of our community in order to foster trust, understanding, and empathy with one another.\\\",\\\"At McMurtry, we stand with you and we aim to be a community where we can treat each other with respect and dignity. We want to always support and celebrate the diverse cultures, backgrounds, and identities of our McMurtry community. You are valued. You are heard.\\\",\\\"We are linking some resources that have been sent out in the past and hope that you take a look at them so we can be better educated and empathetic. These resources are powerful ways to continue to understand the aspects of race and racism.\\\"],\\\"links\\\":[{\\\"text\\\":\\\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/05/30/bad-apples-come-from-rotten-trees-in-policing/\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/05/30/bad-apples-come-from-rotten-trees-in-policing/ \\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"History of ICE (kinda long article, but has valuable information)\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://qz.com/1316098/what-is-ice-supposed-to-do-the-strange-history-of-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement/amp\\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"How ICE itself presents its history\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://www.ice.gov/features/history/2#content2\\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Coronavirus and ICE(short article):\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/us/ice-coronavirus-deportation.html\\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"International students and ICE(short article):\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/ice-rule-harvard-international-students-rescinded/2020/07/14/319fdae0-c607-11ea-a99f-3bbdffb1af38_story.html\\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Challenging Diversity Training\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090261618301505\\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Read our town hall presentation slides during the summer of 2020\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tNSEUmrXIkulgMXexYhzSGjEFbb6-uOqeGHBsxTCbOg/edit?usp=sharing\\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Taylor Crain’s “Do's and Don’ts for Talking About Racial Injustice”\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vq3VJ6ZE6uRgM960F5jZZtfKxPv7LfGh5ZFomzcgISM/\\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Links and quotes from all of the “Black at Rice” features on the Thresher\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gowEWUCOGIYwCMXTXMfX1IUZi9m42yrefEGx5TLE1Mc/edit?usp=sharing\\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"JUSTICE CAN'T WAIT: INDEPENDENCE DAY AGENDA FOR HOUSTON POLICING\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://www.aclutx.org/en/publications/justice-cant-wait-independence-day-agenda-houston-policing?fbclid=IwAR1zGdm5XJChr6nJCTjKLrhbc10JbJD2yEktsRC6o9tWPyFMUK5RbCqKaVo\\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Rice Taskforce on Slavery, Segregation, and Racial Injustice\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://taskforce.rice.edu\\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Rice Office of Multicultural Affairs\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://oma.rice.edu\\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Rice for Black Life FB\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://www.facebook.com/RiceForBlackLife/?__tn__=%2Cd%2CP-R&eid=ARB25_ENAwIzLcoK7ues9JDRfEZEqo-NzdpKSI2uzx2z_a5UHC-sAKa_jbFPpX9mVwWnt_uJTDpBK-cR\\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"The Racist Housing Policy That Made Your Neighborhood\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/the-racist-housing-policy-that-made-your-neighborhood/371439/\\\"},{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Lots of great articles by Ibram X.
