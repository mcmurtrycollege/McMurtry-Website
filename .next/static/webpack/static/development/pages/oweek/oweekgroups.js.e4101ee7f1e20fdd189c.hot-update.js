You THINK you know what you’re gonna get but he still manages to surprise you. He’s majoring in Bioengineering AND he’s a pre-med (he’s quite the brave soul). He’s a meme connoisseur (arguably his greatest attribute). He’s one of the funniest guys I have ever met, and he can always make you smile with his terribly good jokes and general way of being. Whether he’s whipping so hard he pops his elbow or taking a giant Bevo he found in a dumpster back to McMurtry, he’s always sure to make you laugh. But aside from how fun of a guy he is, he’s also an incredibly caring dude. Rolando is going to be a fantastic advisor. He has the motivation and commitment to help anyone who needs it, whether it’s academic or personal. His fun, upbeat personality is sure to be a warm welcome to Rice."},{"name":"Sophie Marx","year":"Sophmore","major":"Cognitive Sciences","from":"Brooklyn, NY","image":"../../../static/oweek/backgammon/Sophie.jpg","bio":"As an Uber driver once said about Sophie, “she talks so loudly for such a small girl.” You will probably hear Sophie Marx before you see her—this 5’3 sophomore Cognitive Science major from McMurtry College is energetic, hilarious, and is so excited to be your oweek advisor. As a former urban outfitters employee, Sophie is a walking urban outfitters ad, always sporting a fuzzy jacket and a fashionable belt. Hailing from New York City, sophie loves a good piece of pizza and is a major broadway enthusiast. Speaking of Broadway, she is also a member of the Philharmonics, Rice’s oldest acapella group, so even her singing in the shower sounds like a concert. Sophie is thoughtful, passionate, and just a fantastically fun person to be around. If you have Sophie as your advisor, you should feel lucky to have such an amazing person as both a friend and mentor"},{"name":"Krithi Pachipala","year":"Sophmore","major":"Neuroscience, Social Policy Analysis","from":"The Woodlands, TX","image":"../../../static/oweek/backgammon/Krithi.jpg","bio":"Hailing from H-Town, this soon to be Dr. Pachipalalalalala, a potential quintuple major, is everything you’ll ever want in an Advisor. In her free time she likes to tell others about all the pre-med requirements she has left or her vegetarian diet that includes chicken. When she’s feeling potato-esque, Krithi can spend all day on Facebook tagging people in memes or dancing to Bollywood remixes on Rice’s Riyaaz dance team. She will always be down for adventures and trouble whether it’s late night dessert, losing her key at least once a week, leaving her backpack in a restaurant overnight, or running into laptop thieves in her room! In all seriousness, though, Krithi is an amazing friend, mentor, dancer, chocolate lover, and will be an advisor you can go to for anything. She is always ready to drop everything to put others’ needs ahead of hers, whether it be for a quick Target run or to just be there as someone to talk to. If you lucked out and got Krithi as your Advisor, her million facial expressions will lighten your mood every time you come across her at Rice, and just know she’s always there to help you anyway she can!"},{"name":"Nathan McCoslin","year":"Sophmore","major":"Political Science","from":"Jewett, TX","image":"../../../static/oweek/backgammon/Nathan.jpg","bio":"Having Nathan as your advisor is an experience you’ll never forget (whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing, I’ll let you decide). All jokes aside, Nathan is one of the most wholesome people at Rice you’ll ever meet. Originally from the small town, Jewett, (THE sculpture capital of Texas - as he reminds us every 5 minutes), this Political Science major has one of the biggest hearts and can talk to you about literally anything. Just don’t ask him to watch a horror movie with you, he might end up being too scared to sleep in his own room that night and beg to sleep on your floor. In the time I’ve known him, he’s never made me fail to smile and is one of the greatest friends you could ever ask for. You’re going to make some unforgettable memories and be constantly laughing with him as your advisor and always know that he’s got your back."}],"image":"../../../static/oweek/backgammon/backgammon_1.jpg"},{"name":"Battleship and Boujee","advisors":[{"name":"Hayden Mast","year":"Sophomore","major":"Mathematical Economic Analysis, Statistics","from":"Austin, TX","image":"../../../static/oweek/battleship/Hayden.jpg","bio":"With the loudest car at McMurtry, you might hear him approaching before you meet him. Whether he’s revving his Mustang engine or revving hearts with his killer smile, Hayden stirs things up wherever he goes. He cares enough that he will truly listen to and consider anything you want to talk about, but not too much that he can’t dish out roasts when he needs to. Hayden’s a guy you can both mess around with and trust, so feel comfortable ribbing him and confiding in him. Most of all, if you’re in his family, he’s always down to ride with you in whatever you do (preferably in his Mustang). This means Hayden will try new things and grow with you. Like your favorite Pokemon, he’s always evolving, and that’s why he inspires us."},{"name":"Ellery Parish","year":"Junior","major":"Social Policy Analysis, Sociology","from":"San Antonio, TX","image":"../../../static/oweek/battleship/Ellery.jpg","bio":"Ellery Parish (pronounced ‘celery’ but without the ‘c’) is a gregarious, loving student athlete from the city of San Antonio. If you need her, you should probably check at the Rec - this hard-working member of swim team dedicates hours every day to trying to cross the pool without drowning. When she’s not underwater, Ellery is always available to give her opinion on any and every topic you can think of. Her double majors of Social Policy Analysis and Sociology have her well-prepped to analyze and give you advice on any situation that comes up, especially where to get breakfast tacos in Texas (although be aware that the best ones are in San Antonio). All in all, Ellery will always be there for you, whether as a friend or a shoulder to lean on (if you can reach it), and will spend the next four years cheering you on in every endeavor you choose. "},{"name":"Dara Okeremi","year":"Sophomore","major":"Bioengineering","from":"Houston, TX","image":"../../../static/oweek/battleship/Dara.jpg","bio":"If you’re ever in an 8 am class, and you want to know how to get up at 7:53, shower, grab breakfast and get to class ON TIME, Dara’s the person you go to. This high-spirited, loud, and tea-loving girl is going to be your go-to for everything (except driving - don’t ask her to drive you around). She’ll always have your back and be your hype-person (yes, she’s loud - why she lived on the quiet floor of McM her freshman year, the world may never know). She’s a part of literally every club on campus and her calendar may stress you out with all the different appointments, but she’ll always make time for those who need her. She’s a BioE so she can engineer creative solutions to all of your problems. Dara doesn’t play games (especially with Physics), but since this is Advance To Go Week, get ready to play games with her as your Advisor."},{"name":"Rohini Kumar","year":"Junior","major":"Neuroscience","from":"Austin, TX","image":"../../../static/oweek/battleship/Rohini.jpg","bio":"If you’re searching for the wisdom and calming presence of Master Oogway from Kung Fu Panda, but feeling downcast because he is a fictional tortoise, worry no more! Rohini Kumar possesses all of that poise and calm and she will also always go out of her way to support you, listen to you, and calm your soul with her soothing demeanor. Look for her on the dance floor, because she is an incredible dancer and captain of the Rice Rasikas dance team! Rohini is a Neuroscience major, so she has has a pretty big brain (that she also knows a lot about)-- but she also has a really big heart, both for her friends and for the world. She is one of the most thoughtful and reliable friends you will ever have, so don’t let this one slip away!"}],"image":"../../../static/oweek/battleship/Battleshipgroup.jpg"},{"name":"Captain Mancala","advisors":[{"name":"Kabir Sood","year":"Sophomore","major":"Economics","from":"Houston, TX","image":"../../../static/oweek/mancala/Kabir.jpg","bio":"A native Houstonian Econ major who’s also a premed, Kabir Sood is all about following his passions. Kabir absolutely loves music and it won’t be long until you catch him singing along to some of his favorite songs, and if you want something a little more formal go see him sing at one of his acapella concerts with the Apollos! You can usually find Kabir practicing his verses for an upcoming song, at the Rec, or out getting some late night food off campus. Did I mention Kabir is a huge Rockets fan? Talk to him about how much he loves the Rockets, or hates the Warriors, and you’ll soon realize how much he knows about basketball, and he definitely wouldn’t mind if you asked him to go to a game. Kabir is a fun loving, genuine, funny guy who is all about doing the things he likes. Ask him about how he manages to balance his interests and academics, or what it’s like to be a premed majoring in Social Sciences. You can also always ask him for music recommendations. Kabir is a great, and I highly recommend getting to know him!"},{"name":"Stoyan Kimitov","year":"Senior","major":"Computer Science","from":"Chicago, IL","image":"../../../static/oweek/mancala/Stoyan.jpg","bio":"Fun, funky, and fresh, Stoyan Komitov (Sto-yawn Co-me-tov) is the guy that does it all. Formerly known as “Row God” or “Guy with the Strong Jaw,” you can now call him your Advisor and new friend. Even though he comes from the far away land of Chicago, Illinois, Stoyan has made Houston his home for the last three years, meaning that he knows all the best places to eat around town! When he isn’t at an early morning rowing practice or fixing something at Rice Bikes, you can catch Stoyan grinding away in Fondren or McMurtry commons trying (and succeeding) to finish a last-minute project. Plus he can make bread! This guy can truly do it all. An avid EDM fan, Stoyan has the high energy of a raver with the passion of … also a raver. Stoyan is a junior Computer Science major whose dedication to his major is high but his love for his friends is higher. Despite being quite the busy body, Stoyan always makes time for his friends, no matter if they live across campus or across the world. Honestly he is one of the best people you will meet, and starting your time here with him will make McMurtry and Rice the best place possible. But seriously, ask him to make you his signature avocado hummus, it’s amazing"},{"name":"Sohil Shah","year":"Sophomore","major":"Mathematical Economic Analysis","from":"Singapore","image":"../../../static/oweek/mancala/Sohil.jpg","bio":"Sohil. Slow-hill. Swole-hill. Mr. Worldwide. Sampath. The man of many monikers reached his peak at the 2019 club tennis banquet when he was awarded “The Walking Meme” award, to no surprise from me and his other teammates; he’s laughing half the time, often at himself. If he’s not laughing, he probably has his raf (resting aloof face) on. He’s constantly confused about America: “What’s the point of pounds, there’s kilograms!” “Is Colorado a city?” If you speak in Fahrenheit only, don’t ask him what the weather is like outside or else he will haughtily reply in Celsius. A Singaporean native, his fashion sense is reminiscent of a model from Crazy Rich Asians (his Air Force 1’s omggggg). All this aside, Sohil will be the best Advisor you could ask for. He’s an incredible friend that’ll go out of his way to make sure you have everything you need. If you ever need someone to make you laugh or you need a hug or someone to listen to you, you know who to go to. You’re gonna have the best O-Week ever with Sohil!!!"},{"name":"Lupita Galvan Tinoco","year":"Senior","major":"Cognitive Science","from":"Austin, TX","image":"../../../static/oweek/mancala/Lupita.jpg","bio":"Lupita is the definition of a mother. Seriously. Think of that one mom friend you have and multiply just how much of a mom they are by 6. That’s Lupita. She’s super nice, super caring, and overall a fantastic person. She’s from Austin (and it kinda shows), she’s a Cognitive Science major (studying dat brain yo), and she has 2 super cute dogs (not at Rice, that’s not allowed). When she’s not excessively studying, she spends her time watching movies (80s or DCOM), decorating her room (puts other rooms to shame, including mine D: ), crafting, thrifting, and probably doing other neat things that she won’t tell me about. She’s a heck of a person, and a heck of a friend, and when you meet her you’re gonna love her."}],"image":"../../../static/oweek/mancala/Capatingroup.jpg"},{"name":"Dice Dice Baby","advisors":[{"name":"Dylan Nguyen","year":"Sophomore","major":"Social Policy Analysis","from":"Dallas, TX","image":"../../../static/oweek/dice/Dylan.jpg","bio":"Congrats!!! Dylan is your Advisor, now prepare for an ~E X P E R I E N C E~. Despite being a hardcore STEM student and comp major, he is also a woke kweeen getting a second degree in Social Policy Analysis and spending his summer working to reform the Texas criminal justice system. But don’t let that give you the impression that he is all work and no play … some of his favorite pastimes include listening to depressing indie music, elevating his broken leg, and balancing the checkbook as college treasurer. But seriously, if you’re looking for a good time, Dylan is your guy. He is known around McMurtry as the life of the party and has the paper plate award to prove it. And if you are ever looking for a spontaneous Beyoncè performance, this skinny legend has got you covered. So get ready for a wild ride and the best O-Week experience of your life!"},{"name":"Alexandra Lim","year":"Sophomore","major":"Undecided","from":"Vancouver, WA","image":"../../../static/oweek/dice/Alexandra.jpg","bio":"From the Portland metropolitan area, this Vancouver native, who is neither from Oregon nor Canada, can literally convince you to do anything. Like write this bio for her or join 3 college committees when you had no intention of doing so. Nevertheless, Alexandra is always down to hangout in commons, go to a campus event, or hit up Rice village for some fun. Single handedly building Martel’s common culture, Alexandra can be found in Martel commons doing anything from contemplating between majoring in Chemistry or Neuroscience to socializing with other Martelians over dinner. A “track star” in the making, she’ll run with you at 10 o’clock at night to catch the Rice Village shuttle for a cup of boba or dance until dawn at Y2K (McMurtry’s public party) because the music is just too good! Deeply in love with food and cafes, Alexandra is always down to go out and try some of the various cuisines and amenities Houston has to offer. And when you leave your wallet in the Lyft you took back together from Golden Dumpling House, faking a British accent and convincing the driver you go to Cambridge, she’ll call him up and get your wallet back! Dang, you sure are lucky to have Alexandra as your advisor!"},{"name":"Natty Askanase","year":"Sophomore","major":"Sports Management, History","from":"New York, NY","image":"../../../static/oweek/dice/Natty.jpg","bio":"Some Reviews: “If you don’t know Natty’s from New York City (the upper west side SPECIFICALLY!) he will make sure you know during O-Week.” “You will never see Natty without his crocs.” “Natty was in the bottom half of his high school class but still got into Rice.” “Natty is cool. 10/10 recommend as an Advisor.” “Natty is a man of many amazing traits, but mainly he’s an amazing friend that’s always gonna put a smile on your face!” "},{"name":"Robert Alexander","year":"Junior","major":"Cognitive Science","from":"Oakland, CA","image":"../../../static/oweek/dice/Robert.jpg","bio":"A little known fact is about Robert Alexander is that his initials actually stand for ‘Really’ and ‘Awesome’. However, an enigma such as he can only be understood through his dorm room decor. Above his bed are eight album covers, featuring artists such as The Strokes, Lorde, and Beach House. He also has several posters, revealing his love for the classics: the Office, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and Star Wars, but PLEASE NOTE that Robert has an extreme aversion to movies or shows in which the title is actually said out loud and may, quite literally, cringe out of his skin. And of course, Robert’s room is only complete with a bottle of hot sauce (stolen from the servery) on his desk. This Cognitive Science major from the Bay Area loves taking long walks through Hermann Park, playing pool, and watching basketball games when he should be doing homework, and I can guarantee he will be the best Advisor you could ask for."}],"image":"../../../static/oweek/dice/Dicegroup.jpg"},{"name":"Hollabackgammon Girl: This Is Bananas","advisors":[{"name":"Amy Mu","year":"Junior","major":"Kinesiology (Health Sciences)","from":"Johns Creek, GA","image":"../../../static/oweek/hollabackgammon/Amy.jpg","bio":"Her full initials are AWM, and once you meet her, she’ll have you saying “AW M-an, where has Amy been all my life?” (Don’t ask what her middle name is, she might bite you.....but I’ll give you a hint: it’s a fast food chain and rhymes with Pendy.) This Health Sciences junior plans to spend her future in saving lives---starting with yours. Although she is majoring in the Natural Sciences, Amy also has great passion for Humanities and the Arts. If you also happen to be an enthusiast of dancing, appreciate thoughtful conversation, ever need homework guidance from a better-hairstyled version of Einstein, or if you have even the slightest sense of humor, you will get along wonderfully with Amy. This creative genius has enough megabyte storage in her brain to remember every little detail about you----in a slightly creepy, but mostly very thoughtful way. If I haven’t emphasized enough how massive her brain is, you’ll be shocked to learn that her heart is even more massive. No matter the place, the time of day, circumstance of happiness or sorrow, Amy will always be eager to be right by your side. Amy is one of the best people that are currently breathing on this planet, and anyone that receives the opportunity to become close to her will quickly come to realize this for themselves. Although college will be a time of new challenges, you can relax a little knowing that you will get to have THE Amy Mu as your advisor. It’s no coincidence that Amy and Allstate Insurance both start with an “A” --- because you’ll be in good hands."},{"name":"Raymond Lau","year":"Senior","major":"Mechanical Engineering","from":"Las Vegas, NV","image":"../../../static/oweek/hollabackgammon/Raymond.jpg","bio":"Hello my dear New Students, let me introduce you to the living legend Raymond Lau! They call him CRAYZYRAYZY the sun-dried delicious raisin because he is wrinkly and unimpressive on the outside but soft and sweet on the inside! This Las Vegas native knows how to play the following things: poker, Pokemon Showdown, the recorder, the trumpet, my heart. Senior MECH Raymond’s reputation precedes him everywhere he goes, and he is known by many names, including but not limited to: Raymond “CAAM” Lau, Mr. McMurtry, Dear Friend to All, “24 Fluid Ounces in 4 Seconds??,” Light of my Life. In all my 80 years living in this here anemone I’ve never met someone more selfless, adventurous, humble, and kind! Get ready for the time of your life, because Raymond is your Advisor!!"},{"name":"Hannah Boyd","year":"Sophomore","major":"Biochemistry","from":"Gaithersburg, MD","image":"../../../static/oweek/hollabackgammon/Hannah.jpg","bio":"Hannah Boyd’s only been at Rice for a year, but she’s already solidified her status as a Murt ICON. Scored multiple game-winning touchdowns as McMurtry’s powderpuff quarterback? Check. Braved through a hot wings eating competition until there were tears streaming down her face? Check. Conquered a cockroach on the first day of O-Week and earned herself the title, “Roach Girl”? Check. This sophomore Biochem major was born in New Jersey but hails from Maryland. When she’s not grinding on homework, you can catch Hannah playing every single IM sport, doing research on cancer treatment targeting mitochondria, reading up on whether we live in a simulation, or listening to Old Town Road on repeat—she may or may not have the lyrics memorized to serenade you. But besides being a rap queen (ask her to freestyle and witness her skills for yourself), Hannah’s a gem of a friend. She’s an extremely genuine person and someone you can talk to for hours about everything and nothing. If you made it into Hannah’s O-Week group, congrats on landing yourself a one-of-a-kind Advisor and a friend for life."},{"name":"Stephanie Xie","year":"Junior","major":"Computer Science Cognitive Science","from":"Wilton, CT","image":"../../../static/oweek/hollabackgammon/Stephanie.jpg","bio":"Hello to the matriculating class at McMurtry! If you’re reading this, congratulations, because it probably means that the lovely and wonderful Stephanie Xie is one of your advisors! Stephanie hails from the 7th residential college in founding order, Edgar Odell LOVETT College and she’s really excited to be your bridge between McMurtry and the rest of Rice! This Wilton, CT native is a (CS)^2 major (the colloquial abbreviation for both the Computer Science and Cognitive Science majors) and is spending her summer in Chicago, IL with Design for America. Stephanie is high key a cat person and Low Key an amazing singer (for context she’s in the Low Keys a cappella group!), so be prepared for a serenade or two about her cat Momo. Most importantly, Stephanie is a great friend and Caring human-being. Feel free to reach out to her for anything, she’s really excited to get to know you!"}],"image":"../../../static/oweek/hollabackgammon/Hollabackgroup.jpg"},{"name":"Hungry Hungry Hippo Mode","advisors":[{"name":"Nneoma Ome","year":"Sophomore","major":"Bioengineering","from":"Sugar Land, TX","image":"../../../static/oweek/hippo/Nneoma.jpg","bio":"Zoom!!! You see someone zipping past you to get to class, even though they aren’t late. Who’s that you might ask yourself? None other than Nneoma Ome. A tall girl that has brains to match her elegance. Nneoma is a Houston native from the suburb of Sugar Land. Which boasts some of the best and brightest the world has seen. It’s almost as if it was meant to be that she’s from Sugar Land and attends Rice University. Nneoma is always open to talking and meeting new people. Some of her hobbies are watching Youtube videos, talking to family and listening to her favorite artist Shawn Mendes. A secret talent Nneoma possesses that she is an amazing volleyball player and an even better leader. She was named the most improved member of her varsity volleyball team in high school. So if you’re lucky enough to catch Nneoma on campus, I would say the best way to spark a conversation with her would be by bringing up Shawn Mendes. Doing that might just kick off a great friendship between the two of you."},{"name":"Jennifer Ho","year":"Junior","major":"Kinesiology, Health Sciences, Multiple Minors","from":"Tomball, TX","image":"../../../static/oweek/hippo/Jennifer.jpg","bio":"Jennifer Ho? THE Jennifer Ho? She’s known as many different things: J. Ho (which is what inspired Jennifer Lopez to go by J. Lo) to her peers, @jenniferhopez to her Instagram fans, @jennifurho to her loyal Twitter followers, and Jennifer Ho, B.A. Kinesiology to her professors and formal email correspondents. You, however, are lucky enough to also get to know her as your incredible Advisor: someone who will welcome you with all the heart she has in her tiny body, always hype you up, support you through the best and worst of times, and serenade you with the singular ukulele chord she’s learned to play. You’ll know when she’s nearby when you see her extremely well-crafted outfit she threw together in 5 minutes for 5 dollars, hear her energetic, genuine laughter, or spot a blur roller-blading across campus at unrealistically high speeds. Chances are, though, Jennifer will already be at your side, no matter what. She is, objectively and undeniably, one of the kindest, warmest and most selfless people you ever will meet. While she is convinced she will win an Oscar for her homemade movies that Youtube has yet to see, Jennifer’s main passion lies in helping people, whether it’s through studying Global Health, Health Disparities, or just through her everyday actions. This junior has abundant love for Rice and McMurtry, and being the #giving person she is, she’s more than ready to share it with you, too."},{"name":"Emma Young","year":"Junior","major":"Mathematical Economic Analysis","from":"Social Analysis Brentwood, TN","image":"../../../static/oweek/hippo/Emma.jpg","bio":"One of the dankest features on Hungry Hungry Hippo Mode is Emma Young (Thug). She’s a junior majoring in Mathematical Economic Analysis and Social Policy Analysis, but you don’t need any analysis at all to figure out why she’s a great advisor. As a tour guide, she can show you the ropes at Rice—and she can do it while walking backwards! At the very least, she will surely show you around her home college Will Rice. She works for Fondren Library, but she’ll never leave you on “read.” If you’re hungry, ask her about her food Instagram. When I’m with Emma, I know Imma be in good hands and so will you."},{"name":"Josh Verne","year":"Sophomore","major":"Computer Science","from":"Raleigh, NC","image":"../../../static/oweek/hippo/Josh.jpg","bio":"Joshua Verne is the most woke person you’ll ever meet, and you can quote me on that. Although originally living in Taiwan for 6 years, Josh is from North Carolina. Not only are they from North Carolina, but they can also list a bunch of other random celebrities that happen to be from North Carolina as well – a talent they commonly share. This sophomore Computer Science genius doesn’t limit their abilities to the computer, but also dabbles in a variety of Sexuality and Gender Classes. If you ever feel the need to have a deep, invoking conversation with someone, Josh is the Advisor for you. Or maybe have you ever just wanted to go on a jog around campus at midnight? Josh does just that. In their free time, you’ll find Josh leaving campus to rock climb, reading some random article, entering themselves into a hot wing eating competition, or running a meeting for Healthier Masculinities (a club they created!). You’ll often hear them asking, “So what about them Dodgers?”, without actually ever knowing what’s happening in baseball. Lucky for you, you’ve landed yourself an incredibly genuine, fun Advisor who’s probably just as excited about O-Week as you are!"}],"image":"../../../static/oweek/hippo/Hungrygroup.jpg"},{"name":"The Jenga Book","advisors":[{"name":"Asli Yilmaz","year":"Senior","major":"Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering","from":"Houston, TX","image":"../../../static/oweek/jenga/Asli.jpg","bio":"Asli, Asli, Asli—Let me tell you about this gal. The moment this Houston native’s car broke down in Rice Village she was fated to make quite the splash at Rice. When she’s not killing it as a Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering student she spends 98% of her waking hours looking at memes on Twitter. She often speaks literally in just vines or occasionally Turkish. When she’s not doing that you might find her prancing around in a white robe and slippers, arguing the cultural significance of Barbie Princess & the Pauper, or furiously popping Lactaid pills before chugging a milky latte. In all seriousness, having Asli as an Advisor is a real treat—she’s super caring and kind and if you ask nicely enough her mom will bring you tasty Turkish goodies. She’s always willing to step up to any task, and she’ll always surpass expectations. She’s the chillest of beans, the diggidiest of bombs, and multiple bees’ knees."},{"name":"Rishi Vas","year":"Junior","major":"Cognitive Science","from":"Dallas, TX","image":"../../../static/oweek/jenga/Rishi.jpg","bio":"MAN OH MAN! If THE RISHI VAS is your Advisor then you have single handedly gotten the BEST ADVISOR! This rambunctious Dallas native (which does not even come close to justifying his love for the Cowboys & Mavericks) will never cease to make you smile and will always make you laugh till you cry. Although this hunk of a man seems to always be injured, when healthy he becomes an athletic freak of nature dominating in basketball, tennis, and volleyball - I am warning you now, you better watch for your ankles cause they are bound to break when he’s on the court. If he’s not dancing his way into your heart, this pre-med Cognitive Sciences major is probably listening to Jon Bellion or eating some great vegan food! You will come to realize that taking a walk across campus with Rishi Vas will take 1000X longer than expected because he will stop by and talk to everyone he crosses path with (this man literally knows everybody). Rishi is the literal life of the party and will always make sure that everyone around him is having as much of a blast as he is. In all seriousness - his smile will always light up the room and his windshield sounding laugh will make you realize you really do have a one of a kind Advisor.

When she’s not impressing the Rice faculty and student body with her high fashion sense, Natalie is pursuing a double major in Anthropology and Econ. A Houston native, she loves the Astros and is a big fan of the second-string Rockets center, Nenê, for some reason. She definitely has her own car, and definitely doesn’t have to ask her mom to use hers when she wants to go off campus. Feel free to ask her for a ride anytime (but give her time to text her mom for permission). When she’s not volunteering around Houston or playing on the club soccer team, she represents McMurtry in intramural sports. How lucky can you get to have her as an advisor? Luckier than Natalie, probably, who regularly says “of course it happens to me” when her computer’s “t” button stops working so she has to sign emails as “Naalie Fesa,” or when she talks about her beloved cat, Percy, who she sleeps in the same bed with and is unfortunately severely allergic to. When you tell her your favorite band, make sure to catch her reaction, because if it’s one of poorly-hidden disgust (which it will be if you don’t like the Avett Brothers or Bob Dylan) then they probably feature in her “cursed” playlist, right up there with Michael “Bubble” and Charlie Puth. No matter what you’re interested in, you’re bound to have a unique connection with Natalie and a great O-Week with her as your Advisor."},{"name":"Ben Harris","year":"Junior","major":"Computer Science","from":"Charlottesville, VA","image":"../../../static/oweek/jenga/Ben.jpg","bio":"It’s a bird! It’s a plane! No, it’s just a tall lanky boy!! Ben Harris, or as his friends call him Lord Byron, is a specimen of a man. Get excited because Ben Harris is a BNOC (big name on campus)!! I say that not because he’s known or involved but because he is literally huge, you can see him from anywhere within a 2-mile radius. Don’t let his height, nice sweaters, and hipster glasses fool you, this man is a goon. Every inch of his 6’6” physique is packed with the most immature sense of humor imaginable. I would pay $50 to see this man go 10 minutes, nay 5, without laughing at something that’s not remotely funny or nothing at all. How is this goof my Advisor you ask? Probably because he’s Duncan College’s Chief Justice, the role of upholding a college’s honor and integrity against all odds. I’ll let you spend O-Week trying to figure out how he got that job.
