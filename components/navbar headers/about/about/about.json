        "McMurtry college is the 10th residential college to grace the Rice campus. A LEED certified brick building located on the northeastern edge of campus, it sits at the optimal location for those seeking the shortest path between their dorms and some of the most popular locations on campus, such as the academic quad (home to many buildings in which students will most likely have classes), Duncan Hall (for all things engineering), and the West Servery (the best place to eat at Rice).",
        "McMurtry first opened its doors in the fall of 2009. The first generation of Murts numbered in the low seventies so the administration grabbed some Will Rice college students to stuff up the remaining space. McMurtry graciously put up with the foreign intrusion and the two groups have learned to coexist peacefully as sister colleges.",
        "The college also boasts many fantastic accommodations like a handy campfire pit in the middle of the quad, a wide roof with a lovely city view and a kitchen on every level. We affectionately call our commons the 'Yurt.' Other facilities include Burt's Teahouse and DeeDee's Lounge on 5th floor, an exercise room on 4th floor, and the game room, music room, theater room, and the McMurtry Innovation Space (MIS) on the 1st floor, with a plethora of study rooms throughout the college."
