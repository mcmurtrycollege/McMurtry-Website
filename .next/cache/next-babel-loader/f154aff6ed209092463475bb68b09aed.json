All throughout O-Week, you will be preparing for\r\n                registration and academic life at Rice and interacting with the rest of your incoming class at McMurtry, but your O-Week group is designed primarily to give you more of a personal\r\n                support system during the week and throughout the year. From playing crazy ice-breakers, learning about each other’s interests and passions, sharing possible course schedules, or making late\r\n                night food runs, you will soon discover that your bond as an O-Week group runs deep. Be prepared\r\n                for lots of fun & encouragement from the peers in your group. Don’t be worried if your Advisors\r\n                seem very enthusiastic when you drive up for move in day -- it’s a sign of affection.\r\n        </p>\r\n            <h2 className='oweek-subtitle'>What is an Advisor?</h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Advisors are a diverse group of students from McMurtry who are so enthusiastic about welcoming\r\n                you to Rice that they don’t mind returning here almost two full weeks before classes start to help\r\n                you move in and start your time at Rice! These fantastic people have been hand-selected to act as\r\n                your guides throughout O-Week; they’ll make sure you get to all activities and meetings, answer\r\n                any questions you might have (or direct you to someone who can answer them), expose you to\r\n                Rice’s academics and student life, introduce you to the McMurtry culture, and serve as all-around\r\n                resources. One thing that all Advisors have in common is their desire to help you have the best\r\n                experience possible at Rice, so they’ll continue to be resources for you long after O-Week is over\r\n                and may very well become some of your closest friends.\r\n        </p>\r\n            <h2 className='oweek-subtitle'>What is a Co-Advisor?</h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Co-Advisors make up about a fourth of our team and are students who are equally friendly and\r\n                enthusiastic about welcoming you to Rice, but they hail from other residential colleges!\r\n                Co-Advisors love McMurtry so much that they choose to join McMurtry’s O-Week as an\r\n                ambassador of their home college. In addition to having the qualities of an Advisor, they can help\r\n                show you Rice beyond the beautiful wood-panels of McMurtry and bring a little bit of their own\r\n                college’s culture and customs along with them. They are wonderful resources in\r\n                helping you to branch out and explore other colleges!\r\n        </p>\r\n            <h2 className='oweek-subtitle'>What is an Affiliate?</h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Affiliates are O-Week personnel who serve specific roles designed to help you with your\r\n                transition to Rice. Most O-Week groups will have at least one Affiliate. While they are paired with\r\n                individual groups, they are an important resource for all New Students at the college. The Affiliate\r\n                assigned to your group may often be floating around to meet other students and providing them\r\n                with specialized knowledge and advice. Be sure to meet all the Affiliates present, as they are incredibly important campus-wide resources during O-Week and beyond. These Affiliate positions\r\n                include: Peer Academic Advisors, Diversity Facilitators, Photographer, Videographer, Gopher, Rice\r\n                Health Advisor, Associates Liaison, Athletic Liaison, Student Maintenance Representative, Chief\r\n                Justice, and President.\r\n        </p>\r\n            <Element name='top'>\r\n                <h2 className='oweek-subtitle'>Find Your O-Week Group!</h2>\r\n            </Element>\r\n            <div className='oweek-groups-links'>\r\n                {\r\n                    oweek_groups.map(({ name }) => (\r\n                        <Scroll.Link to={name} smooth={true} duration={400} key={name}>\r\n                            <div className='oweek-group-link'>\r\n                                {name}\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </Scroll.Link>\r\n                    ))\r\n                }\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='oweek-groups'>\r\n            {\r\n                oweek_groups.map(({ name, advisors, image, video }) => (\r\n                    <Element name={name} key={name}>\r\n                        <div className='oweek-group'>\r\n                            <h2 className='oweek-title'>{name}</h2>\r\n                            <Box width={0.7} ml='auto' mr='auto' style={{ marginTop: '1%', marginBottom: '3%' }}>\r\n                                <Image src={image} alt='Error Loading Image' />\r\n                            </Box>\r\n                            <div className='oweek-bios'>\r\n                                {\r\n                                    advisors.map(({ name, year, major, from, image, bio }) => (\r\n                                        <Box className='advisor-card' key={name} width={[0.95, 0.8]}>\r\n                                            <h2>{name}</h2>\r\n                                            <h3 style={{ fontWeight: 'normal' }}>{year} | {major} | {from}</h3>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <Box width={[0.5, 0.2]} style={{ float: 'left', marginRight: '20px' }}>\r\n                                                    <Image src={image} alt='Error Loading Image' />\r\n                                                </Box>\r\n                                                {bio}\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </Box>\r\n                                    ))\r\n                                }\r\n                            </div>\r\n                            <div className='oweek-video-desktop'>\r\n                                <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src={video} frameBorder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                            <div className='oweek-video-mobile'>\r\n                                <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"200\" src={video} frameBorder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </Element>\r\n                ))\r\n            }\r\n        </div>\r\n        <GoTop />\r\n    </div>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default Groups;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
