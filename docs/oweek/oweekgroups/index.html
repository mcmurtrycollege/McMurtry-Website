All throughout O-Week, you will be preparing for registration and academic life at Rice and interacting with the rest of your incoming class at McMurtry, but your O-Week group is designed primarily to give you more of a personal support system during the week and throughout the year. From playing crazy ice-breakers, learning about each other’s interests and passions, sharing possible course schedules, or making late night food runs, you will soon discover that your bond as an O-Week group runs deep. Be prepared for lots of fun &amp; encouragement from the peers in your group. Don’t be worried if your Advisors seem very enthusiastic when you drive up for move in day -- it’s a sign of affection.</p><h2 class="oweek-subtitle">What is an Advisor?</h2><p>Advisors are a diverse group of students from McMurtry who are so enthusiastic about welcoming you to Rice that they don’t mind returning here almost two full weeks before classes start to help you move in and start your time at Rice! These fantastic people have been hand-selected to act as your guides throughout O-Week; they’ll make sure you get to all activities and meetings, answer any questions you might have (or direct you to someone who can answer them), expose you to Rice’s academics and student life, introduce you to the McMurtry culture, and serve as all-around resources. One thing that all Advisors have in common is their desire to help you have the best experience possible at Rice, so they’ll continue to be resources for you long after O-Week is over and may very well become some of your closest friends.</p><h2 class="oweek-subtitle">What is a Co-Advisor?</h2><p>Co-Advisors make up about a fourth of our team and are students who are equally friendly and enthusiastic about welcoming you to Rice, but they hail from other residential colleges! Co-Advisors love McMurtry so much that they choose to join McMurtry’s O-Week as an ambassador of their home college. In addition to having the qualities of an Advisor, they can help show you Rice beyond the beautiful wood-panels of McMurtry and bring a little bit of their own college’s culture and customs along with them. They are wonderful resources in helping you to branch out and explore other colleges!</p><h2 class="oweek-subtitle">What is an Affiliate?</h2><p>Affiliates are O-Week personnel who serve specific roles designed to help you with your transition to Rice. Most O-Week groups will have at least one Affiliate. While they are paired with individual groups, they are an important resource for all New Students at the college. The Affiliate assigned to your group may often be floating around to meet other students and providing them with specialized knowledge and advice. Be sure to meet all the Affiliates present, as they are incredibly important campus-wide resources during O-Week and beyond. These Affiliate positions include: Peer Academic Advisors, Diversity Facilitators, Photographer, Videographer, Gopher, Rice Health Advisor, Associates Liaison, Athletic Liaison, Student Maintenance Representative, Chief Justice, and President.</p><div name="top"><h2 class="oweek-subtitle">Find Your O-Week Group!</h2></div><div class="oweek-groups-links"><a><div class="oweek-group-link">Backgammon Street Boys</div></a><a><div class="oweek-group-link">Battleship and Boujee</div></a><a><div class="oweek-group-link">Captain Mancala</div></a><a><div class="oweek-group-link">Dice Dice Baby</div></a><a><div class="oweek-group-link">Hollabackgammon Girl: This Is Bananas</div></a><a><div class="oweek-group-link">Hungry Hungry Hippo Mode</div></a><a><div class="oweek-group-link">The Jenga Book</div></a><a><div class="oweek-group-link">La La Candyland</div></a><a><div class="oweek-group-link">Lil’ Yahtzee</div></a><a><div class="oweek-group-link">Panic at the Risk-O</div></a><a><div class="oweek-group-link">Schoolboy Clue: Collard Mr. Green</div></a><a><div class="oweek-group-link">UNO Mars: Draw 24k Magic</div></a></div></div><div class="oweek-groups"><div name="Backgammon Street Boys"><div class="oweek-group"><h2 class="oweek-title">Backgammon Street Boys</h2><div width="0.7" style="margin-top:1%;margin-bottom:3%" class="sc-bdVaJa Lzwky"><img src="../../../static/oweek/backgammon/backgammon_1.jpg" alt="Error Loading Image" class="sc-bdVaJa sc-bZQynM bOkINr"/></div><div class="oweek-bios"><div class="advisor-card sc-bdVaJa dzqUqh" width="0.95,0.8"><h2>Rolando Marquez</h2><h3 style="font-weight:normal">Senior<!-- --> | <!-- -->Bioengineering<!-- --> | <!-- -->Pasadena, TX</h3><div><div width="0.5,0.2" style="float:left;margin-right:20px" class="sc-bdVaJa kvIYis"><img src="../../../static/oweek/backgammon/Rolando.jpg" alt="Error Loading Image" class="sc-bdVaJa sc-bZQynM bOkINr"/></div>Rolando is like a box of chocolates. You THINK you know what you’re gonna get but he still manages to surprise you. He’s majoring in Bioengineering AND he’s a pre-med (he’s quite the brave soul). He’s a meme connoisseur (arguably his greatest attribute). He’s one of the funniest guys I have ever met, and he can always make you smile with his terribly good jokes and general way of being. Whether he’s whipping so hard he pops his elbow or taking a giant Bevo he found in a dumpster back to McMurtry, he’s always sure to make you laugh. But aside from how fun of a guy he is, he’s also an incredibly caring dude. Rolando is going to be a fantastic advisor. He has the motivation and commitment to help anyone who needs it, whether it’s academic or personal. His fun, upbeat personality is sure to be a warm welcome to Rice.</div></div><div class="advisor-card sc-bdVaJa dzqUqh" width="0.95,0.8"><h2>Sophie Marx</h2><h3 style="font-weight:normal">Sophmore<!-- --> | <!-- -->Cognitive Sciences<!-- --> | <!-- -->Brooklyn, NY</h3><div><div width="0.5,0.2" style="float:left;margin-right:20px" class="sc-bdVaJa kvIYis"><img src="../../../static/oweek/backgammon/Sophie.jpg" alt="Error Loading Image" class="sc-bdVaJa sc-bZQynM bOkINr"/></div>As an Uber driver once said about Sophie, “she talks so loudly for such a small girl.” You will probably hear Sophie Marx before you see her—this 5’3 sophomore Cognitive Science major from McMurtry College is energetic, hilarious, and is so excited to be your oweek advisor. As a former urban outfitters employee, Sophie is a walking urban outfitters ad, always sporting a fuzzy jacket and a fashionable belt. Hailing from New York City, sophie loves a good piece of pizza and is a major broadway enthusiast. Speaking of Broadway, she is also a member of the Philharmonics, Rice’s oldest acapella group, so even her singing in the shower sounds like a concert. Sophie is thoughtful, passionate, and just a fantastically fun person to be around. If you have Sophie as your advisor, you should feel lucky to have such an amazing person as both a friend and mentor</div></div><div class="advisor-card sc-bdVaJa dzqUqh" width="0.95,0.8"><h2>Krithi Pachipala</h2><h3 style="font-weight:normal">Sophmore<!-- --> | <!-- -->Neuroscience, Social Policy Analysis<!-- --> | <!-- -->The Woodlands, TX</h3><div><div width="0.5,0.2" style="float:left;margin-right:20px" class="sc-bdVaJa kvIYis"><img src="../../../static/oweek/backgammon/Krithi.jpg" alt="Error Loading Image" class="sc-bdVaJa sc-bZQynM bOkINr"/></div>Hailing from H-Town, this soon to be Dr. Pachipalalalalala, a potential quintuple major, is everything you’ll ever want in an Advisor. In her free time she likes to tell others about all the pre-med requirements she has left or her vegetarian diet that includes chicken. When she’s feeling potato-esque, Krithi can spend all day on Facebook tagging people in memes or dancing to Bollywood remixes on Rice’s Riyaaz dance team. She will always be down for adventures and trouble whether it’s late night dessert, losing her key at least once a week, leaving her backpack in a restaurant overnight, or running into laptop thieves in her room! In all seriousness, though, Krithi is an amazing friend, mentor, dancer, chocolate lover, and will be an advisor you can go to for anything. She is always ready to drop everything to put others’ needs ahead of hers, whether it be for a quick Target run or to just be there as someone to talk to. If you lucked out and got Krithi as your Advisor, her million facial expressions will lighten your mood every time you come across her at Rice, and just know she’s always there to help you anyway she can!</div></div><div class="advisor-card sc-bdVaJa dzqUqh" width="0.95,0.8"><h2>Nathan McCoslin</h2><h3 style="font-weight:normal">Sophmore<!-- --> | <!-- -->Political Science<!-- --> | <!-- -->Jewett, TX</h3><div><div width="0.5,0.2" style="float:left;margin-right:20px" class="sc-bdVaJa kvIYis"><img src="../../../static/oweek/backgammon/Nathan.jpg" alt="Error Loading Image" class="sc-bdVaJa sc-bZQynM bOkINr"/></div>Having Nathan as your advisor is an experience you’ll never forget (whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing, I’ll let you decide). All jokes aside, Nathan is one of the most wholesome people at Rice you’ll ever meet. Originally from the small town, Jewett, (THE sculpture capital of Texas - as he reminds us every 5 minutes), this Political Science major has one of the biggest hearts and can talk to you about literally anything. Just don’t ask him to watch a horror movie with you, he might end up being too scared to sleep in his own room that night and beg to sleep on your floor. In the time I’ve known him, he’s never made me fail to smile and is one of the greatest friends you could ever ask for. You’re going to make some unforgettable memories and be constantly laughing with him as your advisor and always know that he’s got your back.</div></div></div><div class="oweek-video-desktop"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-aLED8Y27Gg" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><div class="oweek-video-mobile"><iframe width="320" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-aLED8Y27Gg" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div></div><div name="Battleship and Boujee"><div class="oweek-group"><h2 class="oweek-title">Battleship and Boujee</h2><div width="0.7" style="margin-top:1%;margin-bottom:3%" class="sc-bdVaJa Lzwky"><img src="../../../static/oweek/battleship/Battleshipgroup.jpg" alt="Error Loading Image" class="sc-bdVaJa sc-bZQynM bOkINr"/></div><div class="oweek-bios"><div class="advisor-card sc-bdVaJa dzqUqh" width="0.95,0.8"><h2>Hayden Mast</h2><h3 style="font-weight:normal">Sophomore<!-- --> | <!-- -->Mathematical Economic Analysis, Statistics<!-- --> | <!-- -->Austin, TX</h3><div><div width="0.5,0.2" style="float:left;margin-right:20px" class="sc-bdVaJa kvIYis"><img src="../../../static/oweek/battleship/Hayden.jpg" alt="Error Loading Image" class="sc-bdVaJa sc-bZQynM bOkINr"/></div>With the loudest car at McMurtry, you might hear him approaching before you meet him. Whether he’s revving his Mustang engine or revving hearts with his killer smile, Hayden stirs things up wherever he goes. He cares enough that he will truly listen to and consider anything you want to talk about, but not too much that he can’t dish out roasts when he needs to. Hayden’s a guy you can both mess around with and trust, so feel comfortable ribbing him and confiding in him. Most of all, if you’re in his family, he’s always down to ride with you in whatever you do (preferably in his Mustang). This means Hayden will try new things and grow with you. Like your favorite Pokemon, he’s always evolving, and that’s why he inspires us.</div></div><div class="advisor-card sc-bdVaJa dzqUqh" width="0.95,0.8"><h2>Ellery Parish</h2><h3 style="font-weight:normal">Junior<!-- --> | <!-- -->Social Policy Analysis, Sociology<!-- --> | <!-- -->San Antonio, TX</h3><div><div width="0.5,0.2" style="float:left;margin-right:20px" class="sc-bdVaJa kvIYis"><img src="../../../static/oweek/battleship/Ellery.jpg" alt="Error Loading Image" class="sc-bdVaJa sc-bZQynM bOkINr"/></div>Ellery Parish (pronounced ‘celery’ but without the ‘c’) is a gregarious, loving student athlete from the city of San Antonio. If you need her, you should probably check at the Rec - this hard-working member of swim team dedicates hours every day to trying to cross the pool without drowning. When she’s not underwater, Ellery is always available to give her opinion on any and every topic you can think of. Her double majors of Social Policy Analysis and Sociology have her well-prepped to analyze and give you advice on any situation that comes up, especially where to get breakfast tacos in Texas (although be aware that the best ones are in San Antonio). All in all, Ellery will always be there for you, whether as a friend or a shoulder to lean on (if you can reach it), and will spend the next four years cheering you on in every endeavor you choose. </div></div><div class="advisor-card sc-bdVaJa dzqUqh" width="0.95,0.8"><h2>Dara Okeremi</h2><h3 style="font-weight:normal">Sophomore<!-- --> | <!-- -->Bioengineering<!-- --> | <!-- -->Houston, TX</h3><div><div width="0.5,0.2" style="float:left;margin-right:20px" class="sc-bdVaJa kvIYis"><img src="../../../static/oweek/battleship/Dara.jpg" alt="Error Loading Image" class="sc-bdVaJa sc-bZQynM bOkINr"/></div>If you’re ever in an 8 am class, and you want to know how to get up at 7:53, shower, grab breakfast and get to class ON TIME, Dara’s the person you go to. This high-spirited, loud, and tea-loving girl is going to be your go-to for everything (except driving - don’t ask her to drive you around). She’ll always have your back and be your hype-person (yes, she’s loud - why she lived on the quiet floor of McM her freshman year, the world may never know). She’s a part of literally every club on campus and her calendar may stress you out with all the different appointments, but she’ll always make time for those who need her. She’s a BioE so she can engineer creative solutions to all of your problems. Dara doesn’t play games (especially with Physics), but since this is Advance To Go Week, get ready to play games with her as your Advisor.</div></div><div class="advisor-card sc-bdVaJa dzqUqh" width="0.95,0.8"><h2>Rohini Kumar</h2><h3 style="font-weight:normal">Junior<!-- --> | <!-- -->Neuroscience<!-- --> | <!-- -->Austin, TX</h3><div><div width="0.5,0.2" style="float:left;margin-right:20px" class="sc-bdVaJa kvIYis"><img src="../../../static/oweek/battleship/Rohini.jpg" alt="Error Loading Image" class="sc-bdVaJa sc-bZQynM bOkINr"/></div>If you’re searching for the wisdom and calming presence of Master Oogway from Kung Fu Panda, but feeling downcast because he is a fictional tortoise, worry no more!

Look for her on the dance floor, because she is an incredible dancer and captain of the Rice Rasikas dance team! Rohini is a Neuroscience major, so she has has a pretty big brain (that she also knows a lot about)-- but she also has a really big heart, both for her friends and for the world.

You can usually find Kabir practicing his verses for an upcoming song, at the Rec, or out getting some late night food off campus. Did I mention Kabir is a huge Rockets fan? Talk to him about how much he loves the Rockets, or hates the Warriors, and you’ll soon realize how much he knows about basketball, and he definitely wouldn’t mind if you asked him to go to a game. Kabir is a fun loving, genuine, funny guy who is all about doing the things he likes. Ask him about how he manages to balance his interests and academics, or what it’s like to be a premed majoring in Social Sciences. You can also always ask him for music recommendations.

Even though he comes from the far away land of Chicago, Illinois, Stoyan has made Houston his home for the last three years, meaning that he knows all the best places to eat around town! When he isn’t at an early morning rowing practice or fixing something at Rice Bikes, you can catch Stoyan grinding away in Fondren or McMurtry commons trying (and succeeding) to finish a last-minute project. Plus he can make bread! This guy can truly do it all. An avid EDM fan, Stoyan has the high energy of a raver with the passion of … also a raver. Stoyan is a junior Computer Science major whose dedication to his major is high but his love for his friends is higher. Despite being quite the busy body, Stoyan always makes time for his friends, no matter if they live across campus or across the world. Honestly he is one of the best people you will meet, and starting your time here with him will make McMurtry and Rice the best place possible.

If he’s not laughing, he probably has his raf (resting aloof face) on. He’s constantly confused about America: “What’s the point of pounds, there’s kilograms!” “Is Colorado a city?” If you speak in Fahrenheit only, don’t ask him what the weather is like outside or else he will haughtily reply in Celsius. A Singaporean native, his fashion sense is reminiscent of a model from Crazy Rich Asians (his Air Force 1’s omggggg). All this aside, Sohil will be the best Advisor you could ask for. He’s an incredible friend that’ll go out of his way to make sure you have everything you need.

Nevertheless, Alexandra is always down to hangout in commons, go to a campus event, or hit up Rice village for some fun. Single handedly building Martel’s common culture, Alexandra can be found in Martel commons doing anything from contemplating between majoring in Chemistry or Neuroscience to socializing with other Martelians over dinner. A “track star” in the making, she’ll run with you at 10 o’clock at night to catch the Rice Village shuttle for a cup of boba or dance until dawn at Y2K (McMurtry’s public party) because the music is just too good! Deeply in love with food and cafes, Alexandra is always down to go out and try some of the various cuisines and amenities Houston has to offer.

He also has several posters, revealing his love for the classics: the Office, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and Star Wars, but PLEASE NOTE that Robert has an extreme aversion to movies or shows in which the title is actually said out loud and may, quite literally, cringe out of his skin. And of course, Robert’s room is only complete with a bottle of hot sauce (stolen from the servery) on his desk. This Cognitive Science major from the Bay Area loves taking long walks through Hermann Park, playing pool, and watching basketball games when he should be doing homework, and I can guarantee he will be the best Advisor you could ask for.</div></div></div><div class="oweek-video-desktop"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PIq1b89oxUY" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><div class="oweek-video-mobile"><iframe width="320" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PIq1b89oxUY" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div></div><div name="Hollabackgammon Girl: This Is Bananas"><div class="oweek-group"><h2 class="oweek-title">Hollabackgammon Girl: This Is Bananas</h2><div width="0.7" style="margin-top:1%;margin-bottom:3%" class="sc-bdVaJa Lzwky"><img src="../../../static/oweek/hollabackgammon/Hollabackgroup.jpg" alt="Error Loading Image" class="sc-bdVaJa sc-bZQynM bOkINr"/></div><div class="oweek-bios"><div class="advisor-card sc-bdVaJa dzqUqh" width="0.95,0.8"><h2>Amy Mu</h2><h3 style="font-weight:normal">Junior<!-- --> | <!-- -->Kinesiology (Health Sciences)<!-- --> | <!-- -->Johns Creek, GA</h3><div><div width="0.5,0.2" style="float:left;margin-right:20px" class="sc-bdVaJa kvIYis"><img src="../../../static/oweek/hollabackgammon/Amy.jpg" alt="Error Loading Image" class="sc-bdVaJa sc-bZQynM bOkINr"/></div>Her full initials are AWM, and once you meet her, she’ll have you saying “AW M-an, where has Amy been all my life?” (Don’t ask what her middle name is, she might bite you.....but I’ll give you a hint: it’s a fast food chain and rhymes with Pendy.) This Health Sciences junior plans to spend her future in saving lives---starting with yours. Although she is majoring in the Natural Sciences, Amy also has great passion for Humanities and the Arts. If you also happen to be an enthusiast of dancing, appreciate thoughtful conversation, ever need homework guidance from a better-hairstyled version of Einstein, or if you have even the slightest sense of humor, you will get along wonderfully with Amy. This creative genius has enough megabyte storage in her brain to remember every little detail about you----in a slightly creepy, but mostly very thoughtful way. If I haven’t emphasized enough how massive her brain is, you’ll be shocked to learn that her heart is even more massive. No matter the place, the time of day, circumstance of happiness or sorrow, Amy will always be eager to be right by your side. Amy is one of the best people that are currently breathing on this planet, and anyone that receives the opportunity to become close to her will quickly come to realize this for themselves. Although college will be a time of new challenges, you can relax a little knowing that you will get to have THE Amy Mu as your advisor.

Conquered a cockroach on the first day of O-Week and earned herself the title, “Roach Girl”? Check. This sophomore Biochem major was born in New Jersey but hails from Maryland. When she’s not grinding on homework, you can catch Hannah playing every single IM sport, doing research on cancer treatment targeting mitochondria, reading up on whether we live in a simulation, or listening to Old Town Road on repeat—she may or may not have the lyrics memorized to serenade you. But besides being a rap queen (ask her to freestyle and witness her skills for yourself), Hannah’s a gem of a friend. She’s an extremely genuine person and someone you can talk to for hours about everything and nothing.

It’s almost as if it was meant to be that she’s from Sugar Land and attends Rice University. Nneoma is always open to talking and meeting new people. Some of her hobbies are watching Youtube videos, talking to family and listening to her favorite artist Shawn Mendes. A secret talent Nneoma possesses that she is an amazing volleyball player and an even better leader. She was named the most improved member of her varsity volleyball team in high school. So if you’re lucky enough to catch Nneoma on campus, I would say the best way to spark a conversation with her would be by bringing up Shawn Mendes.

You’ll know when she’s nearby when you see her extremely well-crafted outfit she threw together in 5 minutes for 5 dollars, hear her energetic, genuine laughter, or spot a blur roller-blading across campus at unrealistically high speeds. Chances are, though, Jennifer will already be at your side, no matter what. She is, objectively and undeniably, one of the kindest, warmest and most selfless people you ever will meet. While she is convinced she will win an Oscar for her homemade movies that Youtube has yet to see, Jennifer’s main passion lies in helping people, whether it’s through studying Global Health, Health Disparities, or just through her everyday actions.

This sophomore Computer Science genius doesn’t limit their abilities to the computer, but also dabbles in a variety of Sexuality and Gender Classes. If you ever feel the need to have a deep, invoking conversation with someone, Josh is the Advisor for you. Or maybe have you ever just wanted to go on a jog around campus at midnight? Josh does just that. In their free time, you’ll find Josh leaving campus to rock climb, reading some random article, entering themselves into a hot wing eating competition, or running a meeting for Healthier Masculinities (a club they created!).

When she’s not killing it as a Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering student she spends 98% of her waking hours looking at memes on Twitter. She often speaks literally in just vines or occasionally Turkish. When she’s not doing that you might find her prancing around in a white robe and slippers, arguing the cultural significance of Barbie Princess &amp; the Pauper, or furiously popping Lactaid pills before chugging a milky latte. In all seriousness, having Asli as an Advisor is a real treat—she’s super caring and kind and if you ask nicely enough her mom will bring you tasty Turkish goodies.

Although this hunk of a man seems to always be injured, when healthy he becomes an athletic freak of nature dominating in basketball, tennis, and volleyball - I am warning you now, you better watch for your ankles cause they are bound to break when he’s on the court. If he’s not dancing his way into your heart, this pre-med Cognitive Sciences major is probably listening to Jon Bellion or eating some great vegan food! You will come to realize that taking a walk across campus with Rishi Vas will take 1000X longer than expected because he will stop by and talk to everyone he crosses path with (this man literally knows everybody).

When she’s not impressing the Rice faculty and student body with her high fashion sense, Natalie is pursuing a double major in Anthropology and Econ. A Houston native, she loves the Astros and is a big fan of the second-string Rockets center, Nenê, for some reason. She definitely has her own car, and definitely doesn’t have to ask her mom to use hers when she wants to go off campus. Feel free to ask her for a ride anytime (but give her time to text her mom for permission). When she’s not volunteering around Houston or playing on the club soccer team, she represents McMurtry in intramural sports. How lucky can you get to have her as an advisor? Luckier than Natalie, probably, who regularly says “of course it happens to me” when her computer’s “t” button stops working so she has to sign emails as “Naalie Fesa,” or when she talks about her beloved cat, Percy, who she sleeps in the same bed with and is unfortunately severely allergic to. When you tell her your favorite band, make sure to catch her reaction, because if it’s one of poorly-hidden disgust (which it will be if you don’t like the Avett Brothers or Bob Dylan) then they probably feature in her “cursed” playlist, right up there with Michael “Bubble” and Charlie Puth.

I would pay $50 to see this man go 10 minutes, nay 5, without laughing at something that’s not remotely funny or nothing at all. How is this goof my Advisor you ask? Probably because he’s Duncan College’s Chief Justice, the role of upholding a college’s honor and integrity against all odds. I’ll let you spend O-Week trying to figure out how he got that job. Despite his inability to close his mouth when he chews, pick up his chacos when he walks, or take anything seriously, Ben is fiercely loyal and the best friend anyone could ask for.

She is an incredibly determined human being who has an addiction to caffeine and decided to add an extra identification to the front of her credit card: her own face. Don’t even get started with her obsession with rose gold. Also, there is no such thing as a sleep schedule for her, as you can find her asleep either at 2 PM or 2 AM, depending on the day. Even though she might be incredibly busy, she genuinely cares about you and will do anything to help you. Originally from Los Angeles, California, she sometimes (always) misses the California sunshine. Find her at Fondy 6th working on chemistry, or generally laughing loud enough to wake everyone up. She’s going to be sure to make your first week and first year at Rice as great as it can be!</div></div></div><div class="oweek-video-desktop"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GO0q-lRWAhI" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><div class="oweek-video-mobile"><iframe width="320" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GO0q-lRWAhI" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div></div><div name="Lil’ Yahtzee"><div class="oweek-group"><h2 class="oweek-title">Lil’ Yahtzee</h2><div width="0.7" style="margin-top:1%;margin-bottom:3%" class="sc-bdVaJa Lzwky"><img src="../../../static/oweek/yahtzee/Lilgroup.jpg" alt="Error Loading Image" class="sc-bdVaJa sc-bZQynM bOkINr"/></div><div class="oweek-bios"><div class="advisor-card sc-bdVaJa dzqUqh" width="0.95,0.8"><h2>Alex Lammers</h2><h3 style="font-weight:normal">Sophomore<!-- --> | <!-- -->Bioengineering<!-- --> | <!-- -->Tecumseh, Michigan</h3><div><div width="0.5,0.2" style="float:left;margin-right:20px" class="sc-bdVaJa kvIYis"><img src="../../../static/oweek/yahtzee/Alex.jpg" alt="Error Loading Image" class="sc-bdVaJa sc-bZQynM bOkINr"/></div>Does Alex look familiar? That’s probably because you recognize this political icon from a CNN town hall when he was chosen to ask a question to then-presidential hopeful, billionaire Howard Schultz. That’s right. He may be a hardcore bioengineer who travelled to Malawi this summer for global health thingies (we aren’t engineers), but he is also a civically engaged, ~woke~ KING. Although he may seem extremely vanilla on the surface, buried deep within him is a sassy monster. However, his sass is not nearly as suppressed as his real laugh, which he hides because if unleashed, an earthquake erupts on the other side of the world. Regardless, if you need someone to discuss feminism in blockbuster action movies, the brilliance of Brie Larson, literally any HBO show, or how to feed tapirs (we didn’t know what they were either) with, and you don’t mind the HEAVIEST midwestern accent on the planet, Alex is your guy. In all seriousness, Alex is one of the most selfless and caring people on the planet and he will always be there for you with an endless supply of tupperware filled with snacks.</div></div><div class="advisor-card sc-bdVaJa dzqUqh" width="0.95,0.8"><h2>Tatyanna Epps</h2><h3 style="font-weight:normal">Sophomore<!-- --> | <!-- -->Sociology<!-- --> | <!-- -->Temple, TX</h3><div><div width="0.5,0.2" style="float:left;margin-right:20px" class="sc-bdVaJa kvIYis"><img src="../../../static/oweek/yahtzee/Tatyanna.jpg" alt="Error Loading Image" class="sc-bdVaJa sc-bZQynM bOkINr"/></div>Tatyanna Epps Bust down Tatyanna!! Or as she likes to be called, Tya. Tya Epps, a sophomore Sociology major, is currently from Temple, Texas but has lived in a bunch of other states – which is too long to list. This girl is a procrastination queen but that doesn’t stop her from killing it at life. As Treasurer of BSA, your McMurtry Diversity Facilitator, and a star Powderpuff line(wo)man, she’s super involved around campus. Not to mention, she’s also a rap queen and literally knows the lyrics to every song imaginable. Don’t even get me started on her love for Nicki Minaj. While we’re on the topic of her various skills, Tya is especially attuned to very faint smells, has a complex palate when it comes to food, and loves very cold climates (keeping her room at meat locker temperatures). Does she have Spidey senses? We think so. You’ll often find her awake at 5am, busting out an essay, or just casually listening to music. Tya is the best type of person for deep conversations but can also be somebody you can easily laugh with. She’s super excited about O-Week and can’t wait to meet you guys!</div></div><div class="advisor-card sc-bdVaJa dzqUqh" width="0.95,0.8"><h2>Sachi Khemka</h2><h3 style="font-weight:normal">Sophomore<!-- --> | <!-- -->Biological Sciences<!-- --> | <!-- -->Katy, TX</h3><div><div width="0.5,0.2" style="float:left;margin-right:20px" class="sc-bdVaJa kvIYis"><img src="../../../static/oweek/yahtzee/Sachi.jpg" alt="Error Loading Image" class="sc-bdVaJa sc-bZQynM bOkINr"/></div>You’re walking to class one morning. Out of the corner of your eye you see the llama from The Emperor’s New Groove. Oh wait. It’s Sachi Khemka. During the 2018-2019 school year, Sachi managed to lose her ID, mail key, and two room keys. Imagine the kind of determination needed to lose so many valuables in such a short period of time! This focus and drive truly defines Sachi’s character and makes her the successful student she is (even though she sleeps through her morning classes…at 4 p.m.). As a premed Biological Sciences major who is also a trained dancer, a Camp Kesem counselor, and a biomedical lab member, Sachi is the kind of person who seems to do it all, but if you ever want someone to watch a trashy rom-com, she will drop everything, walk over and join you (probably like 20 minutes later because this girl is nothing if not punctual)! Her favorites include The Last Song (mainly because of Liam Hemsworth), The Fosters, and The Vampire Diaries. Never watch horror movies with her, though. This girl is even scared of her own face in the mirror. Also, a piece of advice: Sachi is going to need to borrow both a laptop, phone charger, and blanket from you at some point, so keep them handy. As Sachi would say, “welcome to Riiiiiice,” and I’m sure you will all ~genuinely~ love your O-Week Advisor :)</div></div><div class="advisor-card sc-bdVaJa dzqUqh" width="0.95,0.8"><h2>Grant Lu</h2><h3 style="font-weight:normal">Senior<!-- --> | <!-- -->Bioengineering<!-- --> | <!-- -->Houston, TX</h3><div><div width="0.5,0.2" style="float:left;margin-right:20px" class="sc-bdVaJa kvIYis"><img src="../../../static/oweek/yahtzee/Grant.jpg" alt="Error Loading Image" class="sc-bdVaJa sc-bZQynM bOkINr"/></div>Have you ever met the human embodiment of charisma?

If that doesn’t let you know enough about his personality, look at the words that almost rhyme with Lu: cool, jewel, fun fuel, nice shoe, too good to be true, lover of voodoo, sleeps no drool, eyes like the moon, blows you away like “atchoo!” and you’ll be stuck to him like G.Lu! Despite being an avid collector of things that are soft, Grant is surprisingly sturdy for someone who got hit by a car.

You can normally find Sean losing pickup games at the rec, showing off some random talent, and losing bets in Super Smash Bros. Sean currently has a standing bet that he’ll make the club basketball team next year, while having no organized-sport basketball experience in his life.

Callie is a dedicated history major, and you can often find her working on readings or an essay at Coffeehouse. If you ever need to see photos of a cute dog, Callie’s family recently got a new puppy, and she WILL show you photos - whether you like it or not! Callie is genuine, an amazing listener, and one of the most enthusiastic people at Rice.

Honestly one of the most open and warm personalities on campus, and you can talk about anything with this girl from how to pretend that your fallen tooth crown was your lucky pebble (ask her to tell that story, it’s so funny you might pee your pants) to the best eateries in Houston. Lily has been through many majors, so she has a well-rounded perspective that makes her easy to connect with. She also has very diverse tastes in music and tv shows, so no matter if you’re a country boy, an EDM babe, a crime show fan, or a K-drama lover, you will find a soul sister in her.

When he’s not talking about Parsippany, or talking about how much he talks about Parsippany, or grinding in ECON or STAT, he’ll help you draw out your most efficient four-year plan for Rice, and make you feel like you truly belong here while doing it.

Sue is always down to eat any type of food with you (especially Korean), learn some new makeup tricks, or just go on a walk around the inner loop to talk about whatever is on your mind. If you catch her awake in the late hours of the night, don’t be surprised if you proudly tell her about how you woke up early or went to the gym and are met with one simple question: “Why?” Sue will always be there to hug you, believe in you, give you her most honest advice, get you some tea, and hand you her famous Perry the Platypus stuffed animal for some extra love (and shame you for trying to better yourself through physical activity).

But when he’s not doing lines of code, you can find AJ at the rec DOMINATING the calf raise machine. Take look at AJ and you’ll notice the voluptuousness of his calves. Every day is a #calf day for AJ. Forget a pillow? No problem! AJ is always willing to lend a calf, and trust me, you’ll get the best night sleep of you life. In his free time he is a crafting king, and will school anyone on PVP servers (I speak from experience). Give me a diamond sword and AJ a wooden pickaxe and he will still win 10/10 times.

Just make sure not to accidentally spell her name MEHERT … or do if you’re looking to get her a personalized secret santa gift (ask Steven Feng about that one). Meheret is the kind of friend who will stay up talking to you for hours about anything, even when both of you definitely have work to do, but some topics that are especially close to her heart are nail art, Gustavo Rocqué from Rocqué Records, the iridocyclitis vine, and the time a goat injured her leg at camp. A talented Turkish dancer, she will gladly teach you the Cotton-Eyed Joe dance when Old Town Road starts playing (it definitely makes sense, just ask her). She also loves jamming to Ethiopian and Latin music on her frequent walks to Fondy basement. If you need advice at 4 am, Meheret’s probably awake. If you need someone to be your fire, Meheret’s your one desire -- she’s got a black belt in taekwondo and she’s not afraid to use it.

To maintain his active lifestyle, this junior scarfs down pizzas from the Hoot (The late-night food stand serving hungry students) on the daily. If the Hoot isn’t opened, Sai’s late-night hunger can only be satiated with Rice Village’s infamous YoYo’s Hotdogs.
