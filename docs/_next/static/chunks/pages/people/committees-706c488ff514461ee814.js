A typical event that we put together is Restaurant Day, where we bring foods from various cultures and share it with the Murt community at large. For example, we might cater traditionally Ethiopian appetizers, a Chinese meal, and a Mexican dessert - the combinations are limitless! We also have a lot of cross-committee collaboration and might work with the East Asian Affinity Group, for example, to help organize our massive Lunar New Year celebrations, or put funding towards buying South Asian snacks during religious holidays. If learning about new cultures and sharing that interest with the Murt community through catered meals, celebrations, and more interests you, then join the Culturals Committee!","heads":[{"name":"Angela Benitez","email":"ab165@rice.edu"},{"name":"Janeilya Davis","email":"jmd25@rice.edu"},{"name":"Shirin Mumtaz","email":"sm312@rice.edu"}],"members":[]},{"name":"Diversity","description":"The Diversity committee is focused on ensuring that DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) is a top priority at McMurtry! This involves being a resource for all of Murt in case they have any DEI related concerns that they would like to see addressed (e.g. lack of inclusion of certain backgrounds in events, interpersonal issues related to DEI, etc.) We also plan events and initiatives that can expose more Murts to the importance of having mature discussions surrounding DEI related topics. This past year, we have done the following initiatives: created a linktree that gives Murts access to lists of DEI resources on and off campus as well as an optionally anonymous feedback form; created a bulletin board (posted near the entrance of Murt commons) where people can post DEI and cultural event flyers; created a DEI instagram where we will be posting information about DEI issues relevant to Rice students right now; and collaborated with affinity groups at Murt to host cultural events.<br/><br/>We plan on hosting more DEI-discussion based events in the near future, as well as increasing communication between the diversity committee and all of Murt through email announcements and reminders of any important upcoming DEI events or DEI-related resources. If you are passionate about increasing the importance of DEI at Murt, you should join this committee!","heads":[{"name":"Crystal Valtierra","email":"cv50@rice.edu"},{"name":"Eriyana Woolfolk","email":"ew73@rice.edu"}],"members":[]}]}]}')},md7G:function(e,t,a){"use strict";function o(e){return(o="function"===typeof Symbol&&"symbol"===typeof Symbol.iterator?function(e){return typeof e}:function(e){return e&&"function"===typeof Symbol&&e.constructor===Symbol&&e!==Symbol.prototype?"symbol":typeof e})(e)}function i(e,t){return!t||"object"!==o(t)&&"function"!==typeof t?function(e){if(void 0===e)throw new ReferenceError("this hasn't been initialised - super() hasn't been called");return e}(e):t}a.d(t,"a",(function(){return i}))},vuIU:function(e,t,a){"use strict";function o(e,t){for(var a=0;a<t.length;a++){var o=t[a];o.enumerable=o.enumerable||!1,o.configurable=!0,"value"in o&&(o.writable=!0),Object.defineProperty(e,o.key,o)}}function i(e,t,a){return t&&o(e.prototype,t),a&&o(e,a),e}a.d(t,"a",(function(){return i}))}},[["7dNd",0,2,1,3,4]]]);
