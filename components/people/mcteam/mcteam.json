        "We are Jenifer Bratter and Noe Perez, the Magisters of McMurtry College, the best college on campus.  There are three things that make McMurtry superior above all other colleges - the people, the people, the people!  Murts are the most wonderful people you will meet at this University! Our mission as Magisters is to help students find connections to others, engage their interests, and see this place as home. We are entering our fifth year as Magisters!",
        "We love getting to know students and having them over at our home for food and fun, but also just chatting to get to know your hopes and dreams.",
        "To get that started, here’s a little about us: Noe and Jenifer have been married for 22 years.  We love to travel, cook, and hang out with friends.  Our most recent travels were to Yellowstone National Park.  We are a couple from all over – Jenifer was born in Brooklyn and Noe hails from South Texas (“the Valley”) and we met at the University of Texas at Austin in the graduate program in Sociology during a conflict about a desk – yes, please ask.",
        "Jenifer is a Professor in the Sociology Department specializing in race and ethnicity and its impact on identity, interpersonal relationships, and life chances. She has been working at Rice since 2006, and she enjoys the creative and intellectually dazzling graduate and undergraduate students.",
        "Noe is a freelance researcher. He loves biking as a way to exercise (ask him about the Bike paths in Houston!), getting to know the Rice community, carpentry, cooking--especially dishes that remind folks of home--and farmer’s markets.",
        "We have two boys.  Ricardo (age 19) is entering his second year at Trinity University. His passions are Parkour, weight lifting, climbing, and his goal is to study architecture and urban studies.  Our son Sam (age 14), who is starting high school this fall, is a guitar player, video gamer, chess enthusiast, and a programmer.",
        "Last, but not least, is our dog, Sunshine Charlie, who loves people (and belly rubs!). He’s a Siberian husky mix that we adopted in Spring of 2022 so he has literally lived his entire life at McMurtry.",
        "Welcome to McMurtry!"

        "My name is Jackie Carrizales and I am the McMurtry College Coordinator. I have been the Coordinator here since the week before O-Week in 2015, but I have been an associate at McMurtry since it opened in the Summer of 2009. I was so excited to be able to be a part of a college from the beginning and see the start of all of the traditions that make each college unique. I can’t believe that I’m lucky enough to spend every day here now and get paid for it!",
        "I have worked at Rice for 14 years. Away from McMurtry, I am married to my husband, Marc, and we have three adult sons, Max, Luke, and Leo. We also have three dogs, Azura, Shorty and Dagon, who think that they control the house (and they really do). My office is on the ground floor right outside the door to the commons. I love when students visit and tell e about what is going on with their lives, so please stop by any time to say 'Hi.' Grab some candy or a cup of coffee or tea.",
        "There are some very comfortable couches and chairs in my office, along with Squishmallows if you need a hug, and puzzles to challenge your brain. I’m always ready to talk about Asian dramas, Korean music, Astros baseball, or whatever interests you!",

        "Both of us are from the Chicagoland area and have been enjoying living in Houston. Matt is an Assistant Professor in the Biosciences Department, where he researches the relationship between soil biodiversity and ecosystem health. All organisms living in soil interest Matt, but insects are his favorite (be sure to ask him about them!).",
        "Priscilla is a Marketing Manager in the biopharmaceutical space and enjoys learning about customer insights to produce impactful marketing strategies. Priscilla has worked in marketing and advertising for well over a decade since graduating with a triple major in college (International Business, Political Science, and French).",
        "Our hobbies and interests are diverse, and we are always excited to share them with you. We both have our individual interests, but together, we enjoy nature walks, reading, coffee, live music, art shows, and all things fitness. We also hope you share your hobbies/interests with us—we are always open to learning new things!",
        "Feel free to introduce yourself if we haven’t already met. We are thrilled to get to know you!"

        "Hiii new Murts! My name is Tamara (pronounced with emphasis on the Tam), and I am entering my seventh year as Resident Associate at the best college. I am the Student Services Administrator in the Dean’s Office here at Rice which entails helping students navigate their way through college life – some paths are more arduous than others and that’s where I can step in and help.",
        "I was born and raised here in Houston. I have a Master’s degree in Sociology and love learning about human variation in every form – cultural, familial, personality, life choices, etc. This means I will want to learn all about your life story, from the mundane to the deep! I have many hot takes on food. I hate the 5 C’s: chocolate, cinnamon, caramel, coconut, and coffee (it’s just an elevated palate thing; only the real ones would understand) and love strawberry, guava, passionfruit, vanilla, and Funfetti.",
        "My hobbies include curating music playlists (ask me about my playlists for each day of the week), birdwatching, nature photography, color consulting, consuming pastries, and games of all sorts – bowling, board games, video games, trivia, you name it. I enjoy reading, listening to dark-sided podcasts, exploring new cities, and finding new Netflix series to watch.",
        "I live here with my daughters Seraphina, Aura, and Lila. Seraphina is a rising 6th grader who enjoys slime, dance performances, swimming, spicy noodles, and unhinged what-if scenarios. Aura is a rising 4th grader who enjoys building things, jiu jitsu, Pokemon, shopping, and being literal. Lila is a rising 2nd grader who enjoys sing-alongs, marble runs, using people as furniture, taking Murts hands and running off with them every time they pass by in the hallway, and pizza bagels.",
        "I look forward to getting to know all of you and The Gems (the shorthand collective name for my daughters) can’t wait to play with you!"

In addition to teaching engineering design courses at the OEDK, over the summers I teach in the Rice Emerging Scholars Program (RESP), and teach a study abroad course in Mexico.",
        "As an undergrad, I studied Mechanical Engineering at Syracuse University then earned a PhD in Engineering Education from Virginia Tech. My research has focused on developing learner-centered environments in engineering classrooms, and teaching and learning metacognitive skills. I love thinking deeply and philosophizing about higher education systems and learning more broadly.",
        "Some of my hobbies include: playing games (from cards and board games, to organized sports and wacky competitions, I am game!), cheering for the Houston Astros - I have season tickets and love attending games, drinking coffee (totally addicted, and no shame!), hosting Dogs & Donuts on 5th, and finding great conversations.",
        "But most of all, I'm passionate about people. For me, it has always been more about who I am sharing moments with, than what I am doing in that moment. My personal life vision is 'to build inclusive community,' and I think every person has a deep desire to be known. Knowing someone starts with listening, and when we are truly known we begin to feel like we belong to a shared experience. So, let's sit together over a meal or a cup of coffee; I am eager to hear your story!!",
        "I live on 3rd floor with my daughter, Frankie and our two pups. Frankie will turn 1 year in September. She enjoys people watching and exploring new foods. Sandy is a dachshund-beagle mix. She was born on the streets in Mexico, crazy story you should ask me about sometime! She loves naps, belly rubs, and doesn't miss a meal!! Nexus is an Australian shepherd mix. He struggles with anxiety, but loves spending time with students, giving hugs, and long walks. If you ever need some puppy time, you can find us in 347; just knock!"
