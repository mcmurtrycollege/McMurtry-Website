To do this, we will host events in our home, share meals with you in the commons, and help you navigate your life at the college.

Her research and teaching focus on race and ethnicity and their significance for the ways individuals identify, form relationships, and experience well-being. She has been professor at Rice since 2006 and sincerely enjoys teaching and mentoring the creative and intellectually dazzling graduate and undergraduate students of the Rice community.  Noe is a researcher with expertise in education and community health. He loves carpentry, cooking, volunteering, kickboxing, and biking. Jenifer was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York and Noe hails from south Texas, known as \u201cthe Valley\u201d.  We met at University of Texas at Austin in the graduate program in Sociology. As a first year grad student, Noe stole Jenifer\u2019s desk in the teaching assistant lounge. We became fast friends, eventually started dating, and later married.  After moving across the country together, they decided to settle in Houston, where Jenifer started teaching at University of Houston and then moved over to Rice.","We have two boys: Ricardo, 15, and Sam, 9. Our kids love watching movies, playing video games, and being creative.  Ricardo\u2019s passion is Sasuke and American Ninja Warrior, the obstacle course shows - he was on the first season of American Ninja Warrior Junior under the name, \u201cThe Origami Ninja\u201d and continues to compete in ninja leagues.  Sam loves dancing and martial arts, especially Brazillian capoeira, which is almost a perfect blend of the two.  Together, they have a shared love of creating short films.  Sam and Ricardo were too happy to create a short video in honor of the 2020\u2019s beer bike theme, \u201cThe Mandapourian\u201d. We have lived in the Rice residential colleges as Head Resident Fellows for five years prior to becoming McMurtry Magisters and have enjoyed bringing some of our favorite hobbies to the students on campus.","We are all eager to welcome you to the college and learn more about the hobbies and activities that you enjoy!  As new students, you are an important part of McMurtry. We will all work together to energize our community.

We completed our PhDs in Development Sociology in 2008.","Between the two of us we have lived, worked, and conducted research in a variety of places including Tijuana, Central Mexico, South Africa, New York, California, and North Carolina.

Abriel is six years old and loves swimming, riding her bike, and going to the Zoo (her favorite animal is the Cheetah). Aar\xf3n is four years old.

She would love nothing more than getting pets from new friends.","As a family we love spending time outdoors, traveling, eating and cooking food. Robin loves reading books and listening to podcasts, lifting weights, cycling, and running. Sergio loves photography, movies, grilling, and exploring new food and restaurants in Houston.","Please feel free to reach out to us and come by to say hello anytime.

In addition to teaching design courses for the Engineering Design Minor, I mentor students in the Sustaining Excellence in Research (SER) Scholars program, and teach in two Rice summer programs \u2013 Summer Experience in Engineering Design (SEED) and Rice Emerging Scholars Program (RESP). I received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Syracuse University and a PhD in Engineering Education from Virginia Tech (Go Hokies!).

I love thinking deeply and philosophizing about higher education systems and learning more broadly.

For me, it has always been more about who I am sharing moments with, than what I am doing in that moment.

He had lots of anxiety in the beginning, and through working with a trainer he has turned into a wonderful companion. I eventually realized that the best home for him was the one he already had.
