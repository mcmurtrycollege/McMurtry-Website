You THINK you know what you’re gonna get but he still manages to surprise you. He’s majoring in Bioengineering AND he’s a pre-med (he’s quite the brave soul). He’s a meme connoisseur (arguably his greatest attribute). He’s one of the funniest guys I have ever met, and he can always make you smile with his terribly good jokes and general way of being. Whether he’s whipping so hard he pops his elbow or taking a giant Bevo he found in a dumpster back to McMurtry, he’s always sure to make you laugh. But aside from how fun of a guy he is, he’s also an incredibly caring dude. Rolando is going to be a fantastic advisor. He has the motivation and commitment to help anyone who needs it, whether it’s academic or personal. His fun, upbeat personality is sure to be a warm welcome to Rice."},{"name":"Sophie Marx","year":"Sophmore","major":"Cognitive Sciences","from":"Brooklyn, NY","image":"../../../static/oweek/backgammon/Sophie.jpg","bio":"As an Uber driver once said about Sophie, “she talks so loudly for such a small girl.” You will probably hear Sophie Marx before you see her—this 5’3 sophomore Cognitive Science major from McMurtry College is energetic, hilarious, and is so excited to be your oweek advisor. As a former urban outfitters employee, Sophie is a walking urban outfitters ad, always sporting a fuzzy jacket and a fashionable belt. Hailing from New York City, sophie loves a good piece of pizza and is a major broadway enthusiast. Speaking of Broadway, she is also a member of the Philharmonics, Rice’s oldest acapella group, so even her singing in the shower sounds like a concert. Sophie is thoughtful, passionate, and just a fantastically fun person to be around. If you have Sophie as your advisor, you should feel lucky to have such an amazing person as both a friend and mentor"},{"name":"Krithi Pachipala","year":"Sophmore","major":"Neuroscience, Social Policy Analysis","from":"The Woodlands, TX","image":"../../../static/oweek/backgammon/Krithi.jpg","bio":"Hailing from H-Town, this soon to be Dr. Pachipalalalalala, a potential quintuple major, is everything you’ll ever want in an Advisor. In her free time she likes to tell others about all the pre-med requirements she has left or her vegetarian diet that includes chicken. When she’s feeling potato-esque, Krithi can spend all day on Facebook tagging people in memes or dancing to Bollywood remixes on Rice’s Riyaaz dance team. She will always be down for adventures and trouble whether it’s late night dessert, losing her key at least once a week, leaving her backpack in a restaurant overnight, or running into laptop thieves in her room! In all seriousness, though, Krithi is an amazing friend, mentor, dancer, chocolate lover, and will be an advisor you can go to for anything. She is always ready to drop everything to put others’ needs ahead of hers, whether it be for a quick Target run or to just be there as someone to talk to. If you lucked out and got Krithi as your Advisor, her million facial expressions will lighten your mood every time you come across her at Rice, and just know she’s always there to help you anyway she can!"},{"name":"Nathan McCoslin","year":"Sophmore","major":"Political Science","from":"Jewett, TX","image":"../../../static/oweek/backgammon/Nathan.jpg","bio":"Having Nathan as your advisor is an experience you’ll never forget (whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing, I’ll let you decide). All jokes aside, Nathan is one of the most wholesome people at Rice you’ll ever meet. Originally from the small town, Jewett, (THE sculpture capital of Texas - as he reminds us every 5 minutes), this Political Science major has one of the biggest hearts and can talk to you about literally anything. Just don’t ask him to watch a horror movie with you, he might end up being too scared to sleep in his own room that night and beg to sleep on your floor. In the time I’ve known him, he’s never made me fail to smile and is one of the greatest friends you could ever ask for. You’re going to make some unforgettable memories and be constantly laughing with him as your advisor and always know that he’s got your back."}],"image":"../../../static/oweek/backgammon/backgammon_1.jpg"},{"name":"Battleship and Boujee","advisors":[{"name":"Hayden Mast","year":"Sophomore","major":"Mathematical Economic Analysis,
