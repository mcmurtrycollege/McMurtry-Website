We are excited to meet you and to nurture the kind, open, and stimulating culture at McMurtry. To do this, we will host events in our home, share meals with you in the commons, and help you navigate your life at the college.

She has been at Rice for 13 years, and she loves mentoring the incredibly talented students she has met here. Chris is a high school math teacher at the High School for the Visual and Performing Arts (HSPVA) in Houston. He loves all sports and has been a high school basketball coach for the last 16 years. We are both from Minneapolis, Minnesota and love the color purple (Purple Rain and the Minnesota Vikings). We met in high school and were married in Minnesota but moved to Atlanta, Georgia shortly afterward for graduate school. We have two girls: Lucy, 15, and Liza, 13, who were born in Atlanta. Our kids love watching movies, reading books, creating art, and swimming. We also have our German Shepherds, Felix, who you will see walking Margaret around campus.

We would like to tell you a little about ourselves so that you will know who keeps walking their heavy-breathing bulldog all around the building.","Alana is from Providence, RI, and Brian is from the rural town of Rehoboth, MA. Both of us have been in Texas for a long time so our accents have been diluted. Alana received her BA in Anthropology from UT Austin and her MED in Educational Anthropology from the University of Houston. Brian received his BA in Kinesiology, and his MA and PhD in Exercise Physiology from UT Austin. We were married in Austin, TX in December of 1995.","Brian accepted a faculty position in the Department of Kinesiology at Rice in 1996, where he currently serves as Professor in the Practice teaching Human Physiology and Exercise Physiology courses. In 2004, he also assumed a new role in Academic Advising, and with a few changes over the years, he currently serves as the Associate Dean of Undergraduates. In this role, he has responsibilities for the Office of Academic Advising, the Center for Career Development, and the Center for Teaching Excellence.","After Alana finished her education, she transitioned to working in software development and technology management. Currently, she works as a Project Manager for OpenStax at Rice University. OpenStax is a nonprofit organization committed to improving student access to quality learning materials. Even though OpenStax textbooks are free, they are very high quality, peer-reviewed, and customizable. For more information, please visit openstax.org.","We both have lots of personal interests. We absolutely love, and dote on our dog, \u201cBogie Theodore Gibson\u201d, and we enjoy travel, exercise, and spending time with family and friends. We also have separate personal interests. Alana enjoys books, music, cooking, and art. Brian enjoys playing and coaching sports, lifting weights, wildlife, and photography. We have been living with students in the residential colleges since we arrived in Houston in 1996, but we were \u201cpromoted\u201d to McMurtry in 2014. As you can tell, we like college life. In fact, we\u2019re not sure we can remember what it is like to NOT be in college. We consider ourselves non-judgmental adults who are here to share our lives with Murts to whatever extent they wish."]},{"position":"Second Floor RAs","names":"Tamara Cobb and Andre Cobb","body":["Hello and welcome!

She has an MA in Sociology and loves learning about human variation in every form \u2013 cultural, familial, personality, life choices, etc. This means she will want to learn all about your life story, so get ready! She hates chocolate, cinnamon, caramel, and peanut butter (she hopes this isn\u2019t a deal-breaker for you) but loves strawberry, cherry, vanilla, and Funfetti! She also enjoys color consulting, wildlife and outdoor adventure shows and books, and games of all sorts \u2013 bowling, board games, video games, you name it.","Andre is the Department Business Administrator in the English department at the University of Houston, and was also born and raised in Houston. He enjoys reading about politics and law, critical film analysis, philosophy (his undergraduate major!), and sports \u2013 particularly the Green Bay Packers and yelling at their coaching staff. Andre and Tamara actually met in freshman year of high school at Bellaire High School!

I am Deirdre Hunter, your new 3rd floor RA. I along with my two pups, Sandy and Nexus, are thrilled to welcome you with open arms and paws. I am a Lecturer of Engineering Design at the Oshman Engineering Design Kitchen (OEDK). In addition to teaching design courses for the Engineering Design Minor, I mentor students in the Sustaining Excellence in Research (SER) Scholars program, and teach in two Rice summer programs \u2013 Summer Experience in Engineering Design (SEED) and Rice Emerging Scholars Program (RESP). I received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Syracuse University and a PhD in Engineering Education from Virginia Tech (Go Hokies!). My research has focused on developing learner-centered environments in engineering classrooms, and teaching and learning metacognitive skills. I love thinking deeply and philosophizing about higher education systems and learning more broadly. Some of my hobbies include: playing games (from cards and board games, to organized sports and wacky competitions, I am game!), cheering on our Houston sports teams (Go Astros!!), drinking coffee (totally addicted, and no shame!) and finding great conversations.","But most of all, I\u2019m passionate about people. For me, it has always been more about who I am sharing moments with, than what I am doing in that moment. My personal life vision is \u201cto build inclusive community\u201d and I think every person has a deep desire to be known. Knowing someone starts with listening, and when we are truly known we begin to feel like we belong to a shared experience. So, let\u2019s sit together over a meal or a cup of coffee; I am eager to hear your story!!","Sandy is a five-year-old dachshund-beagle mix. She was born on the streets in Mexico and one afternoon, she found her way to my front gate, and eventually into my heart and my family. When I moved back to the States, she came with me. She loves naps, sun bathing, belly rubs, and doesn\u2019t miss a meal!! Nexus is a five-year-old collie-Australian shepherd mix who started as my foster dog. He had lots of anxiety in the beginning, and through working with a trainer he has turned into a wonderful companion. I eventually realized that the best home for him was the one he already had. So he became my foster-failure and the third member of our little family. Nexus loves people, walks, and rough housing."]},{"position":"Gone But Never Forgotten","names":"Brad Blunt and Marla Sanders","body":["The 3rd floor RA apartment is home to Brad & Marla, plus three kids and a shaggy mutt - all of whom are excited for all of you to be part of an exciting year at McMurtry.","Born in Ohio, raised in Illinois, and educated in Iowa, Brad never expected to leave the Midwest, until a voice teacher invited him to venture down to Texas for a while. That was in 1996. He\u2019s been here pretty much ever since, and since 2012 he has been an Assistant Director of Academic Advising at Rice.","Marla, on the other hand, was born in Houston and stayed put. Why leave a good thing, right? She works beyond the hedges (that\u2019s Rice-Speak for \u201coff-campus\u201d) as a sales representative for The Detering Company. If a house in Houston is fancy with something custom-\xadbuilt out of wood, her company probably did the work.","Brad\u2019s passion is music. He has a master\u2019s degree in voice and sang for several seasons at Houston Grand Opera, which allowed him to be a pirate, a slave, a gypsy, a marauding assassin and a Parisian flower vendor in just one year. Marla is the real chanteuse of the duo, and she also loves design and making things with her hands (and a lot of hot glue). Together, we enjoy reading, local bars with live music, hiking, and ice cream. We REALLY like ice cream.","Brad\u2019s children, Jonah and Sophie, spend most of the school year near San Antonio, but you will see them most weekends. Jonah is entering 7th grade and is into video games, reading, and playing percussion. Fifth-\xadgrader Sophie is the family animal lover and artist, and she is following in her father\u2019s footsteps by always trying to be the biggest ham in the room. She has a lot of competition for that title from Marla\u2019s daughter Ainsley, who is also in 5th grade and has an encyclopedic knowledge of Harry Potter and Minecraft. Smokey the shaggy mutt is very friendly and loves to play. He also is the guest of honor for the best study break of the year.
