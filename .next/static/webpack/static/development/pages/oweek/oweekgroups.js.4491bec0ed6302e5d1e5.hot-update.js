You THINK you know what you’re gonna get but he still manages to surprise you. He’s majoring in Bioengineering AND he’s a pre-med (he’s quite the brave soul). He’s a meme connoisseur (arguably his greatest attribute). He’s one of the funniest guys I have ever met, and he can always make you smile with his terribly good jokes and general way of being. Whether he’s whipping so hard he pops his elbow or taking a giant Bevo he found in a dumpster back to McMurtry, he’s always sure to make you laugh. But aside from how fun of a guy he is, he’s also an incredibly caring dude. Rolando is going to be a fantastic advisor. He has the motivation and commitment to help anyone who needs it, whether it’s academic or personal. His fun, upbeat personality is sure to be a warm welcome to Rice."},{"name":"Sophie Marx","year":"Sophmore","major":"Cognitive Sciences","from":"Brooklyn, NY","image":"../../../static/oweek/backgammon/Sophie.jpg","bio":"As an Uber driver once said about Sophie, “she talks so loudly for such a small girl.” You will probably hear Sophie Marx before you see her—this 5’3 sophomore Cognitive Science major from McMurtry College is energetic, hilarious, and is so excited to be your oweek advisor. As a former urban outfitters employee, Sophie is a walking urban outfitters ad, always sporting a fuzzy jacket and a fashionable belt. Hailing from New York City, sophie loves a good piece of pizza and is a major broadway enthusiast. Speaking of Broadway, she is also a member of the Philharmonics, Rice’s oldest acapella group, so even her singing in the shower sounds like a concert. Sophie is thoughtful, passionate, and just a fantastically fun person to be around. If you have Sophie as your advisor, you should feel lucky to have such an amazing person as both a friend and mentor"},{"name":"Krithi Pachipala","year":"Sophmore","major":"Neuroscience, Social Policy Analysis","from":"The Woodlands, TX","image":"../../../static/oweek/backgammon/Krithi.jpg","bio":"Hailing from H-Town, this soon to be Dr. Pachipalalalalala, a potential quintuple major, is everything you’ll ever want in an Advisor. In her free time she likes to tell others about all the pre-med requirements she has left or her vegetarian diet that includes chicken. When she’s feeling potato-esque, Krithi can spend all day on Facebook tagging people in memes or dancing to Bollywood remixes on Rice’s Riyaaz dance team. She will always be down for adventures and trouble whether it’s late night dessert, losing her key at least once a week, leaving her backpack in a restaurant overnight, or running into laptop thieves in her room! In all seriousness, though, Krithi is an amazing friend, mentor, dancer, chocolate lover, and will be an advisor you can go to for anything. She is always ready to drop everything to put others’ needs ahead of hers, whether it be for a quick Target run or to just be there as someone to talk to. If you lucked out and got Krithi as your Advisor, her million facial expressions will lighten your mood every time you come across her at Rice, and just know she’s always there to help you anyway she can!"},{"name":"Nathan McCoslin","year":"Sophmore","major":"Political Science","from":"Jewett, TX","image":"../../../static/oweek/backgammon/Nathan.jpg","bio":"Having Nathan as your advisor is an experience you’ll never forget (whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing, I’ll let you decide). All jokes aside, Nathan is one of the most wholesome people at Rice you’ll ever meet. Originally from the small town, Jewett, (THE sculpture capital of Texas - as he reminds us every 5 minutes), this Political Science major has one of the biggest hearts and can talk to you about literally anything. Just don’t ask him to watch a horror movie with you, he might end up being too scared to sleep in his own room that night and beg to sleep on your floor. In the time I’ve known him, he’s never made me fail to smile and is one of the greatest friends you could ever ask for. You’re going to make some unforgettable memories and be constantly laughing with him as your advisor and always know that he’s got your back."}],"image":"../../../static/oweek/backgammon/backgammon_1.jpg"},{"name":"Battleship and Boujee","advisors":[{"name":"Hayden Mast","year":"Sophomore","major":"Mathematical Economic Analysis, Statistics","from":"Austin, TX","image":"../../../static/oweek/battleship/Hayden.jpg","bio":"With the loudest car at McMurtry, you might hear him approaching before you meet him. Whether he’s revving his Mustang engine or revving hearts with his killer smile, Hayden stirs things up wherever he goes. He cares enough that he will truly listen to and consider anything you want to talk about, but not too much that he can’t dish out roasts when he needs to. Hayden’s a guy you can both mess around with and trust, so feel comfortable ribbing him and confiding in him. Most of all, if you’re in his family, he’s always down to ride with you in whatever you do (preferably in his Mustang). This means Hayden will try new things and grow with you. Like your favorite Pokemon, he’s always evolving, and that’s why he inspires us."},{"name":"Ellery Parish","year":"Junior","major":"Social Policy Analysis, Sociology","from":"San Antonio, TX","image":"../../../static/oweek/battleship/Ellery.jpg","bio":"Ellery Parish (pronounced ‘celery’ but without the ‘c’) is a gregarious, loving student athlete from the city of San Antonio. If you need her, you should probably check at the Rec - this hard-working member of swim team dedicates hours every day to trying to cross the pool without drowning. When she’s not underwater, Ellery is always available to give her opinion on any and every topic you can think of. Her double majors of Social Policy Analysis and Sociology have her well-prepped to analyze and give you advice on any situation that comes up, especially where to get breakfast tacos in Texas (although be aware that the best ones are in San Antonio). All in all, Ellery will always be there for you, whether as a friend or a shoulder to lean on (if you can reach it), and will spend the next four years cheering you on in every endeavor you choose. "},{"name":"Dara Okeremi","year":"Sophomore","major":"Bioengineering","from":"Houston, TX","image":"../../../static/oweek/battleship/Dara.jpg","bio":"If you’re ever in an 8 am class, and you want to know how to get up at 7:53, shower, grab breakfast and get to class ON TIME, Dara’s the person you go to. This high-spirited, loud, and tea-loving girl is going to be your go-to for everything (except driving - don’t ask her to drive you around). She’ll always have your back and be your hype-person (yes, she’s loud - why she lived on the quiet floor of McM her freshman year, the world may never know). She’s a part of literally every club on campus and her calendar may stress you out with all the different appointments, but she’ll always make time for those who need her. She’s a BioE so she can engineer creative solutions to all of your problems. Dara doesn’t play games (especially with Physics), but since this is Advance To Go Week, get ready to play games with her as your Advisor."},{"name":"Rohini Kumar","year":"Junior","major":"Neuroscience","from":"Austin, TX","image":"../../../static/oweek/battleship/Rohini.jpg","bio":"If you’re searching for the wisdom and calming presence of Master Oogway from Kung Fu Panda, but feeling downcast because he is a fictional tortoise, worry no more! Rohini Kumar possesses all of that poise and calm and she will also always go out of her way to support you, listen to you, and calm your soul with her soothing demeanor. Look for her on the dance floor, because she is an incredible dancer and captain of the Rice Rasikas dance team! Rohini is a Neuroscience major, so she has has a pretty big brain (that she also knows a lot about)-- but she also has a really big heart, both for her friends and for the world. She is one of the most thoughtful and reliable friends you will ever have, so don’t let this one slip away!"}],"image":"../../../static/oweek/battleship/Battleshipgroup.jpg"},{"name":"Captain Mancala","advisors":[{"name":"Kabir Sood","year":"Sophomore","major":"Economics","from":"Houston, TX","image":"../../../static/oweek/mancala/Kabir.jpg","bio":"A native Houstonian Econ major who’s also a premed, Kabir Sood is all about following his passions. Kabir absolutely loves music and it won’t be long until you catch him singing along to some of his favorite songs, and if you want something a little more formal go see him sing at one of his acapella concerts with the Apollos! You can usually find Kabir practicing his verses for an upcoming song, at the Rec, or out getting some late night food off campus. Did I mention Kabir is a huge Rockets fan? Talk to him about how much he loves the Rockets, or hates the Warriors, and you’ll soon realize how much he knows about basketball, and he definitely wouldn’t mind if you asked him to go to a game. Kabir is a fun loving, genuine, funny guy who is all about doing the things he likes. Ask him about how he manages to balance his interests and academics, or what it’s like to be a premed majoring in Social Sciences. You can also always ask him for music recommendations. Kabir is a great, and I highly recommend getting to know him!"},{"name":"Stoyan Kimitov","year":"Senior","major":"Computer Science","from":"Chicago, IL","image":"../../../static/oweek/mancala/Stoyan.jpg","bio":"Fun, funky, and fresh, Stoyan Komitov (Sto-yawn Co-me-tov) is the guy that does it all. Formerly known as “Row God” or “Guy with the Strong Jaw,” you can now call him your Advisor and new friend. Even though he comes from the far away land of Chicago, Illinois, Stoyan has made Houston his home for the last three years, meaning that he knows all the best places to eat around town! When he isn’t at an early morning rowing practice or fixing something at Rice Bikes, you can catch Stoyan grinding away in Fondren or McMurtry commons trying (and succeeding) to finish a last-minute project. Plus he can make bread! This guy can truly do it all. An avid EDM fan, Stoyan has the high energy of a raver with the passion of … also a raver. Stoyan is a junior Computer Science major whose dedication to his major is high but his love for his friends is higher. Despite being quite the busy body, Stoyan always makes time for his friends, no matter if they live across campus or across the world. Honestly he is one of the best people you will meet, and starting your time here with him will make McMurtry and Rice the best place possible. But seriously, ask him to make you his signature avocado hummus, it’s amazing"},{"name":"Sohil Shah","year":"Sophomore","major":"Mathematical Economic
