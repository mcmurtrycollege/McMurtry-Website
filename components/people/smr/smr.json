Some of my roles and responsibilities include attending to your room troubles like thermostats and more, overseeing the inflow of public-space work orders, and representing you and McMurtry as your Rice H&D liaison. Some of my favorite fun facts to share are that I’m a violinist and singer in Rice’s Mariachi Luna Llena, I’m originally from Monterrey, Mexico and have lived in Sachse, TX for the past 11 years, I’m also a Christian who’s involved in InterVarsity, and I’m currently learning the Mandarin language!!! If you ever need anything feel free to message me by text or email ⭐ and I wish you a great day ahead."
