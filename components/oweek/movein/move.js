        <h1 className='oweek-title'>Arrival and Move In</h1>
        <p>
            Plan to arrive in the morning on Sunday, August 18th. The Coordinators will email you soon about
            exactly what time your floor will move in. Enter Rice through Entrance #1 (the main entrance),
            take your first right (after driving a little while), and follow the signs for McMurtry. After unloading, we’ll give you directions for where to park for the rest of the morning. As you drive towards
            McMurtry, Advisors will be outside holding signs and probably yelling your name. Don’t worry,
            they are simply excited to finally meet you!
        </p>
        <p>
            As the Advisors, and maybe some helpful football players, empty your car and start moving your
            stuff into the building (that’s right - you don’t have to do ANY work), you and your family will be
            introduced to our wonderful College Coordinator, Jackie, who will give you your keys and other
            important information. After you check that all your belongings are in your room, you will meet
            the Magisters of McMurtry College, Margaret and Chris, who will welcome you to McMurtry and
            Rice. This will be their fourth year serving as Magisters, and they are soooo excited to meet you!
            You may have time before noon to sit in our beloved Yurt (what we call the McMurtry Commons)
            and mingle with your future classmates. Get to know these faces, because they are likely to become
            very good friends of yours in just a few weeks!
        </p>
        <p>
            Around noon, there will be a buffet lunch for you, your family, and your Advisors. At 12:45 pm, it
            will be time to say a final goodbye to your parents, and head off to join your O-Week group for the
            first time. While your family and loved ones stay behind for a New Families Orientation, you will
            be starting one of the most jampacked and fun-filled weeks of your college career!!!
