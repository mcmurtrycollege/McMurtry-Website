We would like to tell you a little about ourselves so that you will know who keeps walking their heavy-breathing bulldog all around the building.","Alana is from Providence, RI, and Brian is from the rural town of Rehoboth, MA. Both of us have been in Texas for a long time so our accents have been diluted. Alana received her BA in Anthropology from UT Austin and her MED in Educational Anthropology from the University of Houston. Brian received his BA in Kinesiology, and his MA and PhD in Exercise Physiology from UT Austin. We were married in Austin, TX in December of 1995.","Brian accepted a faculty position in the Department of Kinesiology at Rice in 1996, where he currently serves as Professor in the Practice teaching Human Physiology and Exercise Physiology courses. In 2004, he also assumed a new role in Academic Advising, and with a few changes over the years, he currently serves as the Associate Dean of Undergraduates. In this role, he has responsibilities for the Office of Academic Advising, the Center for Career Development, and the Center for Teaching Excellence.","After Alana finished her education, she transitioned to working in software development and technology management. Currently, she works as a Project Manager for OpenStax at Rice University. OpenStax is a nonprofit organization committed to improving student access to quality learning materials. Even though OpenStax textbooks are free, they are very high quality, peer-reviewed, and customizable. For more information, please visit openstax.org.","We both have lots of personal interests. We absolutely love, and dote on our dog, \u201cBogie Theodore Gibson\u201d, and we enjoy travel, exercise, and spending time with family and friends. We also have separate personal interests. Alana enjoys books, music, cooking, and art. Brian enjoys playing and coaching sports, lifting weights, wildlife, and photography. We have been living with students in the residential colleges since we arrived in Houston in 1996, but we were \u201cpromoted\u201d to McMurtry in 2014. As you can tell, we like college life. In fact, we\u2019re not sure we can remember what it is like to NOT be in college.

She hates chocolate, cinnamon, caramel, and peanut butter (she hopes this isn\u2019t a deal-breaker for you) but loves strawberry, cherry, vanilla, and Funfetti!

I am Deirdre Hunter, your new 3rd floor RA. I along with my two pups, Sandy and Nexus, are thrilled to welcome you with open arms and paws.

In addition to teaching design courses for the Engineering Design Minor, I mentor students in the Sustaining Excellence in Research (SER) Scholars program, and teach in two Rice summer programs \u2013 Summer Experience in Engineering Design (SEED) and Rice Emerging Scholars Program (RESP). I received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Syracuse University and a PhD in Engineering Education from Virginia Tech (Go Hokies!). My research has focused on developing learner-centered environments in engineering classrooms, and teaching and learning metacognitive skills. I love thinking deeply and philosophizing about higher education systems and learning more broadly. Some of my hobbies include: playing games (from cards and board games, to organized sports and wacky competitions, I am game!), cheering on our Houston sports teams (Go Astros!!), drinking coffee (totally addicted, and no shame!) and finding great conversations.","But most of all, I\u2019m passionate about people. For me, it has always been more about who I am sharing moments with, than what I am doing in that moment. My personal life vision is \u201cto build inclusive community\u201d and I think every person has a deep desire to be known. Knowing someone starts with listening, and when we are truly known we begin to feel like we belong to a shared experience. So, let\u2019s sit together over a meal or a cup of coffee; I am eager to hear your story!!","Sandy is a five-year-old dachshund-beagle mix. She was born on the streets in Mexico and one afternoon, she found her way to my front gate, and eventually into my heart and my family. When I moved back to the States, she came with me. She loves naps, sun bathing, belly rubs, and doesn\u2019t miss a meal!! Nexus is a five-year-old collie-Australian shepherd mix who started as my foster dog. He had lots of anxiety in the beginning, and through working with a trainer he has turned into a wonderful companion. I eventually realized that the best home for him was the one he already had. So he became my foster-failure and the third member of our little family.
